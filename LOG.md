* TODO
    * Fix: accessibility audit of themes / fix contrasts / create a11y specific themes?
    * Fix: allow "autoloaded" components to be hooked to a DOM element?
        * maybe drop `exponent` altogether, or figure out a better `onInit` / `onDestroy` lifecycle system?

* TOTHINK
    * look into implementing [microformats](https://microformats.io/)
    * look into implementing [webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)
    * a `vim-motion`-like way of navigating links/buttons on the website from the keyboard :)

* try editing markdown in browser with http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/emterpreter/vim.html
    - with preview
    - ..?

* try search powered by: https://stork-search.net/docs/config-ref/
    - yeah?
    - dunno...

* is the better source of truth for content the Markdown, or the JSON?
    * considering I'm already intermixing markdown with JSON, and produce a JSON file for final consumption, why not just stick everything in JSON, and use references to markdown files to build the pages (markdown content would be like... a module; a page without "editorial ccontent" would just be a JSON with basic configuration
    * minimal JSON
    * block-stitching; there's already something to use "blocks" easily, see in `resume.html`

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "title": "Bookmarks",
        "description": "Let's say this is a description",
        "type": "page"
    },
    "blocks": [
        {
            "component": "blocks/markdown",
            "file": "/content/bookmarks.md"
        },
        {
            "component": "blocks/newsletter"
        },
        {
            "component": "blocks/markdown",
            "file": "/content/bookmarks.footer.md"
        }
    ]
}
```

* fix vertical alignment of comments box
    * **when I've got some time**
    * ResizeObserver ?
    * box: onresize
        - calculate height of contained div
        - resize frame to match?
        - allow box to sit smack in the middle?

* maybe work with services?
    * **when I'm building something new, ----> LATER**
    - keyboard shortcut service
    - event service (with state service -> like a reducer?)
    - viewport service? -> where in the page, how big, media, etc.
    - loader service?
        - to determine when all the components on the page are loaded and ready,
        - toggle a loading animation/state
    - storage service -> localStorage / indexedDB

* add svg symbols support
    - **postponing until redesign**
    - for header icons and others (replace arrows, etc.)

* change a staterized value with reefer?
    - **HOLD FOR NOW -> thing might change when using a vdom implementation**
    - everything in `.changed()` will get called, dude
    - pass... a staterized state PLUGGED with the messaging middleware
    - that way you have a redux-like thing
        - an event calls a "reducer" function
        - the reducer updates `stater` keys
        - whatever's hooked in `stater.changed` is updated?
    * can dynamically set spring

* add some sort of GUI page... to rebuild pages?
    - **this is a bit far out...**
    - how to make it... secure?
    - or only build that page when developing?
    - but it would be nice to have it online too

* for `static generation` ... from JS templates, import CSS
    - do test with `hyperapp-notes` ?
    - or the preact project?... I don't know dude

* test `storeon`

* pass protect?

* exponent
    - only one "child" selector (combine ui/control)
        - get dataset from all?
    - children ( data-child="something" )
        - then can destructure in component

```
export default ({ children }) => {
    const { something } = children

    console.log( something.dataset )
})
```

    - keep the user's data on their disk
    - they need to sync it between devices

        - decentralized account and data retention
        - how to handle encryption?
        - gotta encrypt end-to-end

    - html web components
    - js -> grab the "scaffold"
        - render function re-renders all the "tracked" DOM elements
    - css -> is injected on a per-component basis
        - can be "lazy-loaded"
        - is "bundle-splitting"?
        - is Sass?
        - we can process the sass on a per-component basis
        - how do we do global variables?
        - they're out there
    - nobody writes html
        - we've never written html (it's always generated by another language)
        - we don't write css -> sass, less, postcss, ... TAILWIND?!?!
        - js... more like, ecmascript2018?! with babel?!? that's weird as fuck

* zorg-based websites?
    * a web-based, bookmarkable, "timer"
        - pomodoro
        - kitchen timing shit
        - reminders?
    * a web-based unit converter that's made for mobile/tablet
        - kitchen utility
    * a web-based recipe repository
