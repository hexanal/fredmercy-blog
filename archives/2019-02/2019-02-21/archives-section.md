`3:27pm:` Having fun with my website, just added a barebone "archives" section so that the index doesn't get over crowded. So now there's a way to store entries away somewhere. It's probably going to lead to issues if anyone links to an entry and then it gets archived: the url changes...

It doesn't have to be though...! But there's navigation logic I'd have to work around. Anyway, it's good enough for now.

`4:11pm:` I'd just started watching it when I [mentioned it earlier this month](/blog/2019-02-03/read), and now season three of [The Good Place (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/) just dropped on Netflix! Let the bingeing begin!

`4:16pm:` Just realized while writing the latest update that internal links are gonna be hard to manage... once I archive a post, everything's gonna be out of whack!... meh, I'll figure it out.
