## about this website

**_Raison d'être:_**

- hosting my [blog](/blog)
- showcasing my web experiments *(coming soon!)*
- and more generally: it's a (public) brain dump, a repository of my notes

**Technology**

- hosted by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
  - ubuntu 16.04
  - nginx
  - nodejs/express
- made by me
  - open sourced [on github](https://github.com/hexanal/fredmercy-blog), you can read the `README.md` file for more technical information

**Privacy**

- I don't use cookies to track you, but I do use a browser feature called [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) which helps this website remember your preferences, mostly for accessibility features (font style, font size, high contrast color scheme, etc.)
- you can leave comments on the posts
  - there's a limit of 25 comments per post
  - you can spam the comments, but please don't do it because it's not nice
  - you can use your real name, but you could also use any name: there is absolutely nothing I could do to tell who posted what

**Tracking**

- if I did any tracking, which I *don't* right now, it would be to tell how many people visited which page, etc. etc. the regular old visits counter we know and love from the Web 1.0
