`11:00am:` I'm slowly finding alternatives to Google (and other big, unavoidable sites & services) but it's not going to be easy to quit YouTube, and Google Maps. They got us good with those amazingly-crafted websites!

Found out about [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com) which is all about privacy and ecryption and all that. Also heard good thing about [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) which is open source, I think. And I'm curious about [ResilioSync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) as well.

`11:11am:` Thinking about changing the structure of the blog entries to actually get rid of the post title, which is a bit superfluous? Although if I post things that _aren't_ journal entries, I might want a title... Food for thought.

`4:27pm:` Just realized today's [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day)!

That is all.
