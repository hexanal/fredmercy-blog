`10:12am:` Got to see [King Buffalo (Official website)](https://kingbuffalo.com/) and it was pretty good. If you're into stoner rock/metal/doom/whateve, then definitely check out the title track from their latest [_Longing To Be The Mountain_ (on Bandcamp)](https://kingbuffalo.bandcamp.com/track/longing-to-be-the-mountain)

Also check out one of the guest bands [The Naked High (Bandcamp)](https://thenakedhigh.bandcamp.com/), which a pretty cool local band.

This stuff's trippy.
