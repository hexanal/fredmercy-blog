`8:51pm:` Once upon a time I really disliked being put under pressure; but these days it's second nature. In fact, I sort of crave a pinch of heat, a _soupçon_ of urgency, to spice things up a bit. I'm stewing in that pressure cooker, son!

`9:04pm:` Someday I'll write up a very heartfelt essay on depression and its effects on one's perception of the future, and how it is nigh impossible to “picture oneself happy in the future” because there is simply **no** picture at all, just the indifference of eternal void staring back at us. But I might just shelve this post indefinitely, as I really want the tone of this weblog to be light and refreshing!! 😄✌️
