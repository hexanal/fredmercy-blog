`4:43pm:` Finally found a digital piano for not too much, even though I had to travel to the other side of the city to pick it up (and that thing was **heavy**, no joke). Now I guess it's just a matter of _playing the damn thing_, learning more every day about composing, and eventually... releasing a couple of tunes, y'all!

As I'm writing these words, this blog isn't exactly _live_ yet: I'm writing and editing blog posts every day but there is no strict process through which I update it online. At some point the blog will have to be updated for every new entry but I still don't have an internet connection at home, so I suppose it will wait until I step inside a caf√© with wifi.

`4:50pm:` My phone case is losing body parts; phone charger port is busted and barely holds on to the USB cable; laptop is starting to act up; etc.: this is what happens when you try to keep your technology for as long as possible: it's slowly falling apart! I shouldn't be mad about the laptop though: it's been over four years and it's still going strong, which is surprising to me.

`9:04pm:` _pfew!_ what a day! And more to come!
