`9:31am:` It's a truly truly sad thing to read, right when you finally get internet at home, that some Australian fascist opened fire in two mosques in New Zealand. The very disturbing thing to me is that when I read such headlines I'm like “oh here's another one”... what the fuck is wrong with us?!

And from what I read on the news outlets, we're blaming it on another _fuck up_ by social media giants: troll the world through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and let your shitty toxic ideas spread out like a wild fire.

Think we'd better come back down and live in reality for a while.

`9:45am:` _ughh!_ I'm sorry about that rant. This blog's supposed to be about fun and quirky shit, and music, and art in general... I'm just tired.

Here's some music. I've been listening a lot to this song by [Cass McCombs (official site)](http://cassmccombs.com/):

`7:10pm:` Definitely need to start reading more music. It's hard, man. But I've been learning my scales, chords... it's gonna be fine, I just gotta get comfortable and then I'll jump crank up the heat on that music theory knowledge.

I should be on track to _maybe_ achieve my goal of learning a full song before the end of the year (on the piano).
