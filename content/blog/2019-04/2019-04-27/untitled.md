`4:27pm:` This week flew by and I haven't achieved much, in terms of creative output. Almost nothing, to be honest! It's a struggle everyday to deal with the present, the past, the future. To take care of daily chores, to work toward an immediate goal, to reflect on the rather distant future, and also... to try and forget the past and move forward.

`7:10pm:` It's a simple of life, consisting in trying to keep it cool, and to do a little bit every day, never losing sight of the ultimate goal, which is to keep my chin up, and to be chipper.

`7:15pm:` I'm toying with the idea of reviving the decaying corpse that is my Twitter account, but only when I have a somewhat consistent amount of content to put out, or anyway, you know, just have anything interesting to say. I don't necessarily want this blog to fall by the wayside so I have to figure out what the Twitter is for, and what this blog is for.

A blog in a vacuum doesn't attract much people so I guess Twitter would become some sort of hook, a portal that brings in visitors from the twitterverse, as it were. The website has to remain the central focus, the Mothership.
