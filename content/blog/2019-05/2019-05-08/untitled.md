`5:21pm:` Quick update... ok. So, yeah, nothing much, eh? Just a typical blog, really: a lot of nothing, a lot of empty updates, a lot of weird hype building, anticipation, etc. A couple months in and I'm already asking myself whether I should keep it up and running!

Nah, it's not that bad; it's circumstancial. Lots of things have happened since I started writing these updates, things which I don't necessarily mention in here, but which sort of slowed me down in my quest towards more creativity. It's simply a long string of false starts, and periods of deep anxiety, that stifled the small amount of inspiration I had struggled to muster up those past few weeks.

To promise anything in the next few weeks would be foolish, but the least I can do is try my darndest to get into a better headspace and finally start working on something.
