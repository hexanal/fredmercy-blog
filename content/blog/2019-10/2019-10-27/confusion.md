`8:52am:` Hi there! Time's marching on, life goes on, I gots to keep getting on, that's the law of the land.

In terms of music-making, I've acquired some more gear that will make the creative process much more fun and organic, and the hope is to also stimulate creativity and motivation and inspiration. There is still hope!

A friend of mine was kind enough to invite me for a jam session and it was such a fucking joy to be playing in a band. It was like being a kid again, so exciting! Maybe more to come from that...!

In terms of life...? Man, I don't know how y'all do it, to be honest. This life is a constant shape-shifting monster chasing you through every corridor, infiltrating your every thought, pushing you, testing you, probing you, trying to get you to slip, like: “HOLD ON TIGHT YOU MOTHERFUCKER! OH LOOK, WHO'S ABOUT TO VEER OFF-TRACK FOR A HOT SECOND?! WHAT, YOU WANNA GIVE UP? IS THAT IT? HAD ENOUGH YET?! GUESS WHAT, TOMORROW I'LL MAKE IT EXTRA DIFFICULT JUST FOR YOU”

Of course I'm being facetious; it's not that bad.

Also, I have a new crappy short song whose codename is a bit weird (I don't even live with a cat) but, *meh*, it is what it is:
