`12:09pm:` Working a little bit on some strange way of leaving comments. Might not work, might actually jeopardize my whole website in terms of security, but heck, at least I tried.

Here's a todo list:

- allow click to popup comment form
	- can live next to the slots (and float to the bottom on mobile? or full screen on mobile...)
- allow comment to be saved (create file)
- allow click on comment that has content
	- fetch comment from array and display comment
- check if comment slot was used before saving post
	- error messages for that
- nice to have: save "author" field in localstorage so that the user doesn't have to always type their name
- loading animations (would love to figure out some ASCII anim)
