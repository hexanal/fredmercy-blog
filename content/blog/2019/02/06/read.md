`12:22pm:` Something I'm slowly realizing is that I have lived my adult life thinking I needed to be self-reliant, self-taught, and all those self-prefixed adjectives & verbs, when in fact one has to sit down and learn from someone at some point. It's just easier, faster, and less risky.

Also, I've found that it's better to never stop learning. Learning is fun, y'all.
