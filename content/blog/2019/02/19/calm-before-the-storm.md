`9:20am:` Trying to motivate oneself while sitting in a caf√© somewhere sunny, somewhere remote, isn't easy. Actually, it isn't easy to get motivated even when everything is its right place these days. But of course, things are set in motion that will force me to take action and get it done!

Music isn't what I pursued for my career, because I was so cowardly and alone that it was out of the question to find a band to practice with (I was learning to play drums) and with school getting a bit harder for me, I finally cracked and let it go at around age 13-14. What a fu~~cking~~ waste! Right at that age when it's recommended to take on some hobby to hang out with like-minded people, I instead decided to retire and dig myself in deeper, doubled-down on PC videogames, dabbled in digital art and sound design before realizing that this "web" thing was gonna get **big**! (note: it did got pretty big)

Art and music are central to my life, even though you wouldn't immediately see it. Emotions conveyed through music is the single most important thing to my existence. Other forms of art are cool too, but they don't move me like music does. And it's a shame I didn't pursue it further.
Maybe it was a way to protect that hobby.

`9:40am:` I'm reluctant to post images on this blog (it's supposed to be a minimalist website, almost 100% text-based) but here are two pictures from my current location: [Picture of street](/files/pictures/travel_2019_02_19.jpg) | [Picture of mountain](/files/pictures/travel_mtn_2019_02_18.jpg)

_Developer rant ahead:_ my blog is a reaction to how bloated web pages have become. I really wanted it to be light, and use as little funky little widgets as possible. I have a little bit of javascript happening, and I'll expand it as days go by and I need to impress my audience (*haha!*) but if it becomes too large, I'll figure out a way to chop it up into bits and only use the bits I need. I was tempted to come up with an image viewer for the pictures above, and it would be, like, **fun** to develop it, but also a bit superfluous: just click on the image, it opens in your browser, you can see it, zoom on it, whatever, save it.

`5:17pm:` Sent some emails, managed my life, has a nano-crisis with the SO. All good now.

Walking back, I realized I really don't take pictures. I was gonna say "I don't take pictures anymore" but I don't know if I ever did take pictures constantly when walking around? Nowadays, even in new environment, if nothing truly fascinating is happening, I just won't immortalize anything. What those eyes of mine have seen... I'll take to my grave.

`7:45pm:` Feeling great about this nerdy blog. As I type these lines, it's not exactly live yet but I will have to road test it some more before taking it for a spin in actual real-life conditions. I think it's also lacking a bit of whimsy, a bit of magic to it... and it's an element about which I'm *lowkey* thinking about, incubating the idea of something special to sprinkle over the usual boredom of everyday *blah blah*.

Going out to play pool now, cheerio.
