`11:54am:` Might have legit blood circulation problems: my fingers are almost always ice cold, as are my feet. Working next to the window when it's... oh god, 7ºC outside, might not be the best idea, also.

What's cool though is that my laptop is overheating so much that it basically turns into a hand warmer.

`6:42pm:` I've been trying to package something I built so I can re-use it on many project without having to copy and paste my compilation pipeline and everything. Also, it's a good exercise for me because I've never actually tried to package anything and have it be “executable” as a neat little package.

Obviously I've been scratching my head about how to best go about doing that, and so far I've got something that seems to work — _sort of_ — but I want to make as light as possible. And also have it be easy to maintain.
