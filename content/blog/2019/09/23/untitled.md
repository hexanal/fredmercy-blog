`6:53pm:` Spending my time trying to feel better and I don't, so that just a very long-winded way of saying I'm not doing anything of my days. But that's just fine.

My laptop I use for **work** is overheating like crazy whenever I use anything graphics-intensive and shuts down on its own when it gets crazy. So, yeah, I've had to get that fixed, along with the rest of the bullshit that's crowding my brain these days.

I just bought two games on the PS4 too, which doesn't help with productivity! Haha!

There is so little to share these days and I'm oversharing online on my crappy blog, which is the closest thing I have for therapy in between the actual therapy sessions, you know? It's only weird because you're reading it!

Anyway, if I manage my emotions just a tad this week and I get some time for myself, maybe work will get done on those songs. Who knows, maybe we'll have a new couple of songs available on that website before the end of the month (which is a personal goal I had, but I'm well on track to miss that deadline! haha)
