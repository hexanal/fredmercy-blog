`10:40am:` Here are four short musical ideas... While these aren't real songs, it's still something I took pleasure in creating, so I guess it's part of my own personal journey to self-actualization, whatever the fuck that means. All I want is to feel good, *sometimes*.

and if it feels like you can't move on from the fear
you've got to realize that it's all in your head

that it's all in your head!

you've got to push on
you've got to weather the storm
you've got to stay strong

I'm still... still a little bit hurt
But still... I'm still here

Still here.
