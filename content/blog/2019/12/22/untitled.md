`2:19pm:` I'm now on vacation so I'm gonna use that to get to work on some songs... tap into a lot of anxiety from the past few weeks, mixed up with some confusing feelings I've caught, in order to squeeze out at least one song I'm halfway proud of.

Also, I should resume practice, and continue learning everything I can about music theory, and keep myself occupied with exercizes and shit. And read more; I should read more... like that book that this friend lent me two months ago and that I haven't started reading yet. I mean, I only read the first page that day when I was high as fuck, but that barely counts.

My Christmas spirit is high this year: got us a good size tree, decorated the flat with some lights. We baked brownies, we did a Christmas brunch today. And I still hate myself. And I did a Christmas wish card that I sent to my parents.

`7:22pm:` Played some music, extracted only one song. I really need to spend more time on this, get more serious with it. I gotta write more. What the fuck am I doing?
