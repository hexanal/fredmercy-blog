`3:51pm:` Don't know if I'm mentioned it because it's personal but that never stopped me before so here goes: I am a father now, since March. And fuck yeah I'm busy! Busy with a ton of shit, and my heart is full full **full** of pure love!

Hopefully this will let me off the hook as far as blog updates are concerned, haha! But it's honestly something I want to get back to: a healthy little blogging routine, talking about random stuff, music, programming, science, people, writing, pets, love, hate, society, whatever comes to heart.

The problem is that I've started about a *BILLION* projects already and the blog sorta fell by the wayside. Right now and for the past few weeks, my objective was to make the whole programming framework a little sturdier, a little easier to improve, bit by bit, with small moves, you know?

If I build it, they will come.

`4:02pm:` Guys, you do know I'm a stoner, a hippie, a white, lanky, gawky, bonafide *nerd*, right? And I found the perfect binge-worthy show on Netflix, created by [Duncan Trussell (official website)](http://www.duncantrussell.com/), whose concept is so weird that it blew my mind right outta my skull, dude: this guy's got a podcast in which he talks about deep philosophical ideas with his guests, but does it with a very delightful sense of humor and with perfect... levity, with a certain _je-ne-sais-quoi!_ if you can pardon my French.

It's called [The Midnight Gospel (IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11639414/reference) and it's trippy as all heck! Much much recommended, plus it's short & saccharine.
