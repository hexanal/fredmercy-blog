`5:20pm:` From now on, the wish is for these updates to be much more factual and "light" than the past couple of entries. Man, I don't know why I put so much pressure on my shoulders: this is just a **blog**!

The search for a better frontend development setup has begun, and right now I'm working on building up something almost from scratch (I'm using Webpack and React), hopefully with a little twist that makes it easy to work with, easy to maintain, etc.

Sometimes it's fun when I see some progress; but other times I'm really frustrated by all the effort invested into that kind of work, for not much in return!

My current goals are:

1. replicate the UI of the current blog;
1. port the content from the current blog;
1. come up with an easy way to add pages, and external projects to this codebase (for demos, experiments, etc.)
1. come up with a way to edit the content on the go from a mobile device

That's only _laying the foundations_ of the website. I don't even want to think about the time needed to generate enough content to make it worthwhile, haha! But we will see ✌️
