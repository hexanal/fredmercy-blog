`2:23pm:` Sure, I might not be sitting super comfortably right now because I have to use a chair from the dining table, but I still managed to get deep into some code and try out a few things. I have made some progress on the new version of the blog; the most frustrating thing is that once it will be completed, it will look pretty much identical to the current one: only the hidden machinery is being rewritten, and this interface will be kept as-is!

Eventually, I plan on revamping the whole UI and maybe fix a bunch of issues with navigation, performance, etc. As I add more pages, I will probably have to rethink the way I'm building it as well, which is anxiety-inducing right now, but I suppose it's inevitable.

Maybe I'll write up something to explain what the hell I've been up to. Also, I was thinking of allowing users to filter out the nerdy blog entries; or maybe use a tag system in order to present content that's less geeky.

On an even more personal note: I'm eager to start working again, even though I have some doubts about the conditions in which I will resume work at this job. It's a bit nerve-racking these days to balance everything, but hey... I'll manage!
