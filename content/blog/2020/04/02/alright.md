`7:59am:` With this pandemic thingie lingering over the spring season, I can't imagine the **world** going back to what it was before. First of all, it's clear we're all getting the same treatment, give or take. No matter who you are, today you just can't escape the state of the **world**. Second of all, we're not about to give up the hope of a better **world**, are we?!

We've just *got* to switch things up, and kick all the best things into high gear, because now's the time.

We have plenty of time to think about all of this. What are we gonna do? I don't have the answers to that great question. But instead, I think about random stuff. Here are some thoughts:

1. This crisis really makes it self-evident that the Internet is what will allow all of us to communicate, share, purchase, entertain ourselves, etc.
As a web developer, I feel grateful to find myself in an **industry** that should remain strong despite this time off, and not only that, but to also find myself able to maybe make a difference in people's lives by building a better web.
1. I think Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality will finally prove to be extremely useful. They will be used in many areas, for professional and entertainment purposes, for productivity purposes, for teaching purposes, and so on to infinity!
1. Connected cities are needed. Sustainable cities are needed. Democratic and "just" cities are needed. We want to live in a highly functioning community without all the dystopian crap.
Fuck corporations, fuck shareholders, fuck profiteers, fuck those greedy bastards trying to amass the most wealth: who got you the amazing things that keep you alive in times like these? Your business acumen? To some extent, sure, I'll give you that, but ultimately the **real deal** is: SCIENCE.
1. In my conversations, my solution to fix everything that's wrong in the world always ended up being a mix of two fundamental things: education and health. Keep your society filled with *healthy educated people*, and I believe you'll see great things happen in no time.
1. Of course, science isn't the only thing you need. We also need a lot more COMPASSION. Less individualism. Work hard on yourself, for yourself, but also for the fabled *greater good*. Listen to [Give it Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8) by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Anyway, I'm rambling!

Also, don't know if you've noticed but I feel a LOT better these days. I'll write all about it soon! For now though, I hope you have a good day! üôè
