`7:47am:` I've been rather productive yesterday: removed the photofeed link from the menu, fixed the comments section, improved the "component" system, etc.

There's now a new item in the menu that allows for some customization! ðŸ‘€

The photofeed was removed, but I'm planning on adding new pages soon. To be honest, this blog might be ripe for a big overhaul soon, maybe using another technology or something.

`8:46am:` The posting schedule is all over the place but honestly, I want to go back to sharing more music, more movies and other cool finds. For that, the process of posting entries should be improved greatly... right now it's a bit painful.
