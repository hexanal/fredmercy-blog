`9:00am:` Quick update before I start work: I've been working hard trying to get that blog back up on its virtual feet!

If you're a nerd like me and you're curious, it's all available open source on Github.

`12:11am:` man... I'm really tired. Feeling like I'm working double shifts, but HEY! That's what it takes sometimes!
