Hi guys! It sure has been a shitty year for the whole World, hasn't been? I was resolved to keep my chin up and chug along, refusing to let my mood be affected by the situation. During the summer it was easy because I had moral support: sunshine and happiness abounded in the household, and work was going great.

Fast forward to now: when I thought my lifelong battle with depression had finally ended, these past few days I've caught it trying to sneak past my defenses again. It knows I hate Christmas; it knows I hate my birthday; it knows I hate when it gets grey and gloomy outside; it knows I'm a prime target when things aren't going great at work.

What I wanted to write about today is probably something I shouldn't write about, but I don't give a fuck: somehow, with the path I have chosen, I always end up working for shameless advertising. And I sort of hate advertisement, I do everything I can to avoid it in my daily life, I think it's a menace to society, a nuisance. How I do end up working for ad agencies, when their goals aren't aligned with mine?

So I'm about to quit. Again.

Working on this website is keeping me busy. Writing blog posts is amusing to me.<sup title="Meanwhile, I fail to connect with my friends because I'm fighting against the social media behemoths by refusing to use their ad-peddling services.">[*]</sup> I will do what I can.
