`4:29pm:` These days I'm eager to get shit done on my website. I see it as some sort of proof-of-concept of what a website can be: minimalist, but only where it makes sense. It should look simple, but full-featured nonetheless.

The objective is to have a space where I can experiment, and learn new things while sharing this process with the world. It's a blog: it's a public diary where I will expose my work. As a frontend developer, it was always important to have a portfolio website, but I've been slacking off on that for a while now. So I'm back at it.

Also: I want to share more stuff. Like: more [bookmarks](/bookmarks), more ideas, some drawings...? I don't know yet what it's gonna be. I just gotta create more, first.
