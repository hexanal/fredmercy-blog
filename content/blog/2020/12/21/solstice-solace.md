`8:42am:` Being super self-analytic, and generally concerned about "my self" means that I'm *selfish*. But, my self-analyses are done in the hope of becoming a more equipped person to deal with the rest of the World. Too bad I was also blind to the fact that being *selfless* is actually a better way to connect with others, which helps with becoming a nicer person, a better friend, and a more trustworthy ally.

In 2021, I will remove the focus from **me, me, me** and instead turn the lens towards others. See what's up with them.

Right now however, is time for a mid-pandemic, end-of-year, oh-my-god-i-can't-deal-with-this-shit *debriefing* session! Here's what comes to mind:

## having a child

- life-changing to say the least; it's life *generating*, and it's beautiful. I wasn't sold on the idea at first, but damn, it's quite a ride!

## SARS-Cov2

- just as I was getting used to my life being forever changed by (what seemed like) a cataclysmic event (having a child), there was now the looming threat of a pandemic
- the birth of my daughter almost perfectly coincided with the day officials in my country started saying “stay home, be safe” to those who had not been paying attention to the news too much
- almost a year later, we're still deep in the throes of this challenge: how will we rid society of this plague?!

## working from home, and working at all

- I am immensely privileged to live in a fantastic home: my personal office is cozy, quiet, clean, fully-furnished, etc. Kitchen cabinets are still stocked with good stuff. We have a bedroom for our daughter. It's a dream.
  - of course, it's one of the silver-lining of this whole ordeal: the fact that we get to stay cozy at home, still wearing pj's while we fire up the video chat, that's cool, right?
  - ... it also **SUCKS**! We're claustrophobic, stuck in a routine, every day is exactly the same, always on video-chat with other disembodied voices (more and more people decide to turn off the webcam, with good reasons), can't see our friends, can't blow off steam drinking beers with the colleagues at some Irish pub downtown... those were the days, eh?!

## web development

- ever since the beginning of the year, I felt a surging wave of motivation, which I'm still riding: my love for the web, for interactivity, games, arts & crafts, etc. was strongly reinvigorated
- I have many side-projects, which are just small tools that hopefully will add up to something I can use to prototype stuff super quickly
- I have bigger ideas, but time is lacking; which is why I'm going the *slowly but surely* route. Once I know I can realize my vision, I'll be leveraging all those tools, and dig through my notes, and I'll be mad efficient.

## music making

- despite having built a pretty sweet home studio, my free time is much more easily spent working on web projects because they're immune to false starts:
  - it's been my personal experience that sitting down and trying to compose music, or to learn an instrument, requires [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). I need to know I have the next 3 or 4 hours for myself, and also I can't disturb the people who live with and around me!
  - I play with friends in what I call a *proto-band* (we don't have a name yet), but with the pandemic it's been super tough; it's definitely something that fires me up, and I want to write songs, and play them! For 2021, I wish to be able to make something happen with that)

## drugs

- **(locally brewed) beer** and **good marijuana** are just about the two best things in the world, especially when you need to chill and watch some random episode of some random show on some random streaming service
  - ... but everything in moderation, kids!
