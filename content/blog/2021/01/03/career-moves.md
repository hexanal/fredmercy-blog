### programming vs. programming

Programming is cool, because:

- you get to build real stuff out of bits of code
- the possibilities are endless
- if you own a computer, you can learn programming *right now!*

Programming sucks, because:

- it's a mountain of gibberish to try and understand
- experts are so far gone that you can't understand them; they use fucked up jargon and speak in stupid-ass techno-babble all the time, trying to *optimize* that, and build this *to scale*, or *reason about* their code. Fuck you, nerds.
- programming is about creating shit, right?! but mostly, you spend your time editing configuration files, and troubleshooting the tools you try to use to "speed things up a bit"
- it's endless *hacking* at everything

_Just kidding_

### a rant on programming in 2020

My biggest problem with programming is with the whole "system administration" aspect of it all.

People who come up with the tools needed to install shit on a "web server" are fucking **psychopaths**. It's a tangled mess of configuration settings, cryptic commands to run, and you need to run them as administrator, didn't you know?! WHY IT'S EASY if you've spent ten years studying this shit every day!

Personally, I've been dealing with this broken system forever and I've been feeling like shit every time I tried to figure it out on my own. I should learn the basics and build confidence as I go, but something tells me there's a better way. It **can't** be the only way to do things, and if it is, then I'm sorry to say this whole "computer business" needs to crash, hard.

Tired of looking at lines of codes, filenames, commands, packages, modules, blah blah... this shit sucks. Absolutely **nothing** is inuitive in this world: the developer experience is nightmare. Building the simplest thing requires that you learn a ton of stuff. Exploration is a **tedious** process.

Ugh. I'm too tired to read the manual. Nobody fucking reads, dude! NOBODY! We want easy to understand, intuitive, modular, **VISUAL** tools. We want things that empower us, that help us build what we want, quick. We're not there yet.

I'm trying to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
