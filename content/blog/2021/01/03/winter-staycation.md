### Today!

What's up!? This entry talks about programming.

I'm trying to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Programming is hard.

Also, my quest is to finally get comfortable with more _devops_ stuff; I'll tackle Docker when I have a minute. I need to get good at databases; install all that shit, postgres, sqlite, couchDB, cockroachDB I don't even know what else, dude... so much shit in that space! Nah, I'm starting with a good old Wordpress website to begin with!

I've been angry at how stupid programming is... I've been trying to write something about it but I don't know if anything makes sense.

### Tomorrow!

More programming, probably! Like, real programming? nah, just some scripting shit
