`7:01pm:` Lately, I've been reading a little too much [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and I don't know whether I'm super affected by ideas being shared there, or if I've “found my crowd”, but from what I've been reading developers seem to be a bit fed up with the state of the web.

To some extent I agree. Creating for the web is still fresh to me because I'm always trying to make cool sh~~i~~t. But the tools feel wrong: they are clunky, not super intuitive, all over the place, maybe even counter-productive sometimes! You know... it reminds me of the time when big companies' websites were built using Flash, while the rest of the low-tech web had to deal with all the HTML quirks. In 2021, us developers are still trying to do everything we can to avoid having to write any HTML or CSS, if we can help it! [React brought JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)#JSX) to write something that's _like_ HTML (but it's really all Javascript) and soon after they did the [same thing to CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS)! Mission accomplished?

No. That's where the modern web lost us all, once again. Now we need armies of senior developers to make sense of a simple website setup sometimes!

My current mission echoes what my fellow _front-end developers_ out there are trying to do, I think, which is:

* making the Internet accessible to all;
* making it simple;
* making it easy to build for

### what's coming then?

This blog is an answer to the bloat of today's Internet. Many bloggers out there don't even bother with colors![*](I for one _need_ my colors, however!)

I hope there will be new trends in the web industry towards these goals:

* building simpler websites (less ads, less popups, less _garbage_, less distractions overall)
* build for a smaller ecological footprint (lower-tech server technologies? less videos/images?)
* finding an easier way to manage the content/data that's handled by the UI
* keep using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) as they mature, to target every type of device
    - That could be useful for building an [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), a concept championed by some people (who?)
    - Personally, I kind of hate this concept unless we build it using unbreakable encryption by default, in a decentralized/p2p/mesh-network kind of way (but that's a job for more knowledgeable people to figure out)
* building on top of new protocols, possibly made into international standards, so that websites can communicate between each other seamlessly?
    - not sure about this one...
