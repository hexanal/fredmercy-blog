`10:23am:` ~~When I tried to publish my website, I obviously ran into some trouble with sqlite3 not working on my Ubuntu 16.04 server because of a problem with my version of python not being the _correct_ one. If what I just wrote makes perfect sense to you, then you're part of the few psychopaths out there who have managed to stay sane while dealing with this crap!~~

**EDIT NOTE**: this was long and ranty and dumb; so I moved it into the [ramblings](/ramblings/big-dumb-tech) section. It's a new thing I'm trying out where I'll vent on my numerous frustrations, publicly, so that people can judge me and decide whether or not they want to hang out with me, hire me, or respect me as a person ðŸ™‚
