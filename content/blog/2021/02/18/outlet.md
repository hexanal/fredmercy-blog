`6:56pm:` Turns out, I love to write. I like to read a lot, too. Ok, let me talk/think about what I usually read, and how I find out about it:

* first thing I'd read all day would be the headlines in my **newsletters**; not the articles they link to, but just to skim over and know what's up with the World.
    - I usually check out the article if it sounds very interesting and/or if I can spare some _attention_
* <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>: a bit all the time, here and there when I have a few _attention_ units to waste
* before work: the news (us, world, local; yes, in that order, weirdly)
* after work: other bloggers new articles, like:
    - <a href="https://christine.website/blog/social-media-mistake-2021-01-26" target="_blank">Christine Dodrill, ‚ÄúWas Social Media a Mistake?‚Äù</a>
    - <a href="https://macwright.com/" target="_blank">Tim McWright's blog</a>
    - <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/" target="_blank">Creative Good's blog</a>

As you can see, it's very very *nerdy*, and I agree completely. Which is why I need to talk to other people more, and ask them about what they fucking read. It's important as fuck to understand what your friends are reading. I mean, reading a pretty private thing, mostly. You _usually_ wouldn't want to share absolutely everything you're reading, to be broadcast out there... would you? Maybe you would... maybe, like people on Goodreads! What kind of user profile can you infer from all this actual data? (this is how people in advertising are thinking...)

In terms of books, not anything right now. I often read articles from my (very large now... damn) pile of unread Nature magazines; and when I read it, I feel simultaneously like the most intelligent person in the World and the most useless asshole the World's even known!!! üòÑ

But the rest of the time, especially during the day: the thing I do is _write_.

Fucking `code`, obviously üòÖ but also emails, and updates on the many services we're using for work, etc. It's a shit-ton (_shitton?_) of actual writing; at least this is how **I choose to view it**.

I'm communicating to other humans through all this digital mean... and I never see them face-to-face, in the flesh. I feel like I'm on **another goddamn planet**.

> In fact I'm convinced I'm an astronaut: and when I need to leave the house I have to wear a highly protective body suit (long johns, a scarf, winter coat, mittens), and a face mask. We're floating in motherfucking space, guys. On a goddamn planet, which is a goddamn rock spinning in the empty void of the Universe, and we're all like... fuck. But we need to talk to each other in real life to figure this shit out, guys. We need to put gravity back on, go back down to Earth.

I'm gonna let myself read stuff now ü§ô
