# What's next?

- [project list](/devlog/project-list)

## Soon

1. experiment on cool shit

## Nice-to-haves, but boring to implement (imo)

1. filtering of *bookmarks* by `tag` (and then, posts, pages, etc. anything)
  - maybe slap a different default template for those?
3. a better dark theme, please... ugh!!!
  - and remove the "black and white"; replace with a "high contrast" theme

## Dreamzone / Experimental / Spicy Ideas

1. search functionality
2. page content builder using JSON modules
3. a visual sitemap/graph, interactive, funky, beautiful, fun, and... useful!?
4. accessibility audit
5. performance audit
6. a good way to nagivate using keyboard shortcurts
  - arrows, or `hjkl` vim-like
  - good nav also for mobile?
7. think about JSON-maker thing
  - what about just referring to blocks which are markdown files
  - import the snippet?... I don't know man
8. opt-in "tracking" -> ask for feedback on a page?
