- not convinced by intermingling the rendered output with the editor panels; but I guess, why not...
- only when in "editing" mode?

- I have to parse the blocks from an original block array, in JSON
  - that's what gets passed to a page, to build it, right?
  - the point is to generate a JSON object that ALSO gets parsed to show the editor window
  - so it would base itself on... the `id` of the block? like `block-name` or something

```json
[
  {
    "block-name": "yeesh",
    "uuid": "whatever-023840923842",
    "any-old": "data",
    "blah-blah": [234, 555, 234, 666]
  },
  {
    "block-name": "columns",
    "uuid": "whatever-023840923842",
    "column1": "some data",
    "column2": "some other data"
  }
]
```

- This is parsed, and create the "editor" array in my model,
- with the proper block fields added:
- it ends up being the `addedBlocks: []` key, in the state of my hyperapp test
- acting on that, also act on the original blocks array:
  - on "save", we re-create the JSON, save it as file (or in database)
  - feed it back into the rendered UI (to see what the changes brought)
  - and parse back the editor view

- every module/block could be "wrapped" inside a `<div class="module">`
  - this could provide the base for the editor UI?

### The nestable challenge

- recursion, bro

At the "adder" level, only care about what we're passing it, right?
So... still, send the whole state as usual, when editing, eh?
`props.state`?
Anyway, once everything is done inside of it... save means
- take the data, wrap it up in a neat package
- shoot that data (props) in the main state, somehow?
- must be a way to then access that data to rebuild the tree?

- can't even build the "edit block" part
- I need to clean this shit up some...

`2:55pm:`

- we've got two parts:
  1. the component that renders some data (arbitrary data, but usually string, numbers, and arrays of those)
  2. the editor UI that renders the fields necessary to create an object that matches the component's expected data

To achieve this, I did this:
- a component that's an object, with some required fields:
  - `id`, `name`, `description`, `fields`, `render`
  - the `render` key contains a function that renders the component when passed some data
  - the `fields` key contains an array of objects that define what/how to render to edit the component's data

Ok. Like a config file. Like a schema. The component itself can live outside

- `/blocks/foo-bar/foo-bar.component.js`
- `/blocks/foo-bar/foo-bar.config.js`
- `/blocks/foo-bar/foo-bar.doc.md`
- `/blocks/foo-bar/foo-bar.spec.js` # if I do tests,haha
- or something like that

To render the editing area, I thought we could fuck shit up with some tree-structure, nestable, recursive thing.

- We parse through the components of the page, and render the editing UI
- the "root" component would always be a `section` component ("section" is a strange name, but... we'll look into that later)
- this component itself is the one that:
  - look into its data
  - it's a list (tree?) of components
  - its render function is just to render a list of components!
  - now... when editing this field:
    - an "ADD BLOCK" button appears
    - edit buttons appear near children components

Ok.

- when clicking "ADD BLOCK":
  - a list of available components is displayed
  - choosing one adds a block inside this section
  - the added block's configuration panel is showing, along with option button:
    - "Save", "Cancel", "Reset", "Duplicate", "Enable/Disable", ...

- when clicking "Save" for a component
  - whatever was modified in the form is sent to the editor
  - the component configuration panel disappears
  - the "editor":
    - takes the data for the whole tree of components' data, saves it as JSON:
      - timestamped: we could easily implement undo/redo to navigate the changes
        - could even save the atomic changes for cool time travel debugging, whatever
    - refreshes the rendered components with the new data

- the `section` (what I call "adder" in the current version) controls the blocks:
  - in its `props`, it keeps a list of whatever block was added in it
  - when in **edit mode**, it shows the "Add block" button, and the "Edit block" buttons for each block
  - otherwise, it renders them all just as usual

- the `addedBlocks` and all that jazz: that's for each "adder" type block (`section`)

`4:52pm:`

- managed to figure out something that might make it all much easier to implement
- gotta figure out HOW to drill through the structure to extract a TREEEEEEE
  - wish there was a way to mix local with global states...
  - the real thing is: a block should be able to update its data in the tree
  - OR the actual data, resides in a JSON file, extracted to a `json-{uuid}.json` / `drawer_0u8ewr238e-wr40923-wrw74wer.json`
  - and each "SAVE", tells the API to do some round trip
    - save that snippet of a JSON into the right folder, right database entry, or whatever
    - from the data in the Tree
    - recreate the whole damn shit
- each "adder" has a list of children blocks
  - each block has its data saved as JSON
  - on initial render, and each subsequent "save":
    - compile all of the new data into an array... HWAST??A>K!!

- when editing a block
  - fetch data from the block
  - stick it in "editor" UI
  - edit
  - save
  - at that point; we save a JSON, for that block
  - but then...
  - we refresh the data

- when editing, we need to put the `data` for a block inside something that takes care of rendering the fields
- this edit UI, SHOULD spit out something that looks exactly like the data
  - how?
  - because the `block type` information, located inside of `fields`
  - give us information about which keys, what kind of data can be edited
  - so the editor, just processes the data that needs to be..
    - leaving the rest of the data untouched!


- each "adder", is a block
  - it keep its own data into a file
  - this file... JSON, contains an array of blocks (children blocks)
    - and it's just references, to a particular block
    - just its `uuid`, and of course... anything that the Adder block itself needs to know
  - so it's just that!

- each "block" has information relative to which props can be edited via the editor UI
  - that's in the sort of schema

- who..."owns" the editor UI that is displayed?
  - should it be each block?
  - should it be orchestrated by each "adder"?
  - the "root" adder can't be "uneditable" in my tests, because otherwise... we'd just be looking at a straight up, page
  - which means that the UI part of the editor, is managed by... each adder
  - one adder on the page:
    - just a list of blocks
    - adding a sub-adder?
      - remember, in the end `adder` is a block: it's just a bunch of fields, arrays, ...
      - now, a block can contain any other block:
      - `image` in a column, `drawer` in another, for example
- difficulty: is the 1-to-1 correspondence between the final data, and the data needed to build the editor UI
  - again, that's what an "adder" block is:
    - **when editing**: move blocks around, add some, remove some, allow editing of blocks, rendering the editing UI for each block, etc.
    - **when displaying**: simply render its children blocks
- remember: you can't edit any page, without a root `adder` block first (gotta rename that motherfucker `node` or something... `edge`? pppssssshhhh, gotta find something better)
- the root `adder` settings are given by the page which needs it; that's the origin of what can be done with the page
- any sub-adder's settings are given by the blocks' settings
  - see into `drawer.js`
