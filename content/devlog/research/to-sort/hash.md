# Hash

-> routing with funky hash with "lisp" parens syntax?
- `/notes#(show-reference 5)`

## from notion:

- `#@image/whatever`
- or something like `/some-url#@view/my-image`
- multiple ones possible
  - e.g. `stuff.ca/gallery/#@view(the-fuck)@pos(-4,-3)`
  - or e.g. `stuff.ca/gallery/#?view/the-fuck?pos/-4,-3`
  - would give you the page, with the `the-fuck` image in the viewer automatically popped up, at the given `pos` position
