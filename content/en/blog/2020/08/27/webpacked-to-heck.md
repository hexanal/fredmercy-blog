`12:12pm:` Working in thirty-minute-long bursts isn't conducive to solving my javascript-bundling problems. It seems like months have passed since I embarked on this journey, working on and off with no real progress to speak of so far.

Let's blame this on the over-complicated, hodge-podge, roundabout way of building modern web applications, with all this bullshit lingo that comes with it: the "bundling" and "hot reloading" and "server-side rendering" and on and on... Look, I'm not against the concepts they represent because I *want* to use them! It's just that there are no correct way of doing things, and everybody's whipping up their own shit. It's dizzying, and frankly, infuriating to have to deep-dive into this crazy code, just so you have a vague understanding of what's going on with the "bundler" before writing the first line of "real code".

`1:50pm:` Maybe I'm trying to go too big, too fast. I should build a very modest bundling tool that suits my admittedly very basic requirements: I want to build a blog. HelloooOOooO! It ain't rocket science!

Also, it's my job to know how to do this, and I've been in this industry for over ten years with little to show for it. Honestly, I'm a bit lost and there is so much to learn... it's freaking me out sometimes.

`5:47pm:` What a day! I'm so tired, but sort of happy. Tomorrow... I'll try to rest.
