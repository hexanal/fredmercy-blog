`9:26pm:` By some miracle, I got some work done today on that blog. I've been taking some (even more) *personal* notes in a difference version of this website, and it helped me get focused on what the actual more pressing next steps were going to be.

I'm writing now in that new version, so I can tell you: it went well! I'm currently working on this new version, and it's far from ready but it's a blast working on it... haha. Oh well.

From the advice of a friend I've been playing [The Last Of Us: Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II) lately, and it's pretty fucking good! Not really a mood lifter, this one, but the whole thing is very, very well done. Gameplay is cool, pacing is cool, story is cool, dialog aren't too weird, or too long. Good job on the whole team, this is serious work.
