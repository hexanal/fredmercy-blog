`8:53pm:` Things are moving around: I'm keeping things fresh, constantly in motion! Seriously though, I'm having fun working on this quirky blog, haha. I've got a handful of ideas for longer "articles" to write, and a billion more for all sorts of code-related improvements and wacky experiments. By the way, it snowed this evening! That's cool! <ins>‚ùÑÔ∏è</ins>

On a personal note, I've caught the first cold of the season and it's a nasty one! <ins>ü§ß</ins> However, it's not my first rodeo and I can feel this body revving up the engine to fight the infection. But I'd rather not catch COVID on top of it all because it's **not** pleasant, and my body would have definitely been unprepared for a double whammy.
