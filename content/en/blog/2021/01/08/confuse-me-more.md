`1:45pm:` Yesterday, I spent most of the afternoon freaking out over [the news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol); maybe some of you did, too?

These motherfuckers better get a grip, and soon. I can't believe these dumbasses, I can't believe the lack of security, I can't believe these social media platforms, man!... _unbelievable!_

`1:48pm:` I've been working on my website a little... added some funky things. I don't know if it performant or cool or well-coded or accessible, but I will have to figure this all out. The [bookmarks](/bookmarks) page now features a very basic filtering mechanism, by tags. I've been thinking about a future ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù¬†section, where I would describe my work on some projects (this is mostly for my _developer_ profile üòÑ)

## movies!

Been on a sci-fi binge for the past few days:\
_<small>(all the links are Wikipedia articles)</small>_

- [The Midnight Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Sky)
  - The new Netflix show; it was available and I felt like watching a space movie
  - It's **not bad!!**
- [Prospect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_(film))
  - Found that one on some listicle online, and decided to watch it on Netflix also
  - now... this one's **very good!**
- [High life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Life_(2018_film))
  - Oh shit!!! This one I had saved for a rainy day a while back... and finally took some time to watch it
  - It's **phenomenal!**
