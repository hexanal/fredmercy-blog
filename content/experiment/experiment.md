Hey, this is an experiment page. Would love to be able to use components straight from the markdown.

[[blocks/drawer
label: Something
content: |

  Ok, this is heavy.

  ## This is super cool yeah!!

  not... really?

]]

[[blocks/audio
src: /files/jam.mp4
]]

But... is that even relevant?

[[blocks/test
heading: This is it!
intro: Welcome to this New World Order
hello:
  - world
  - kitty
  - goodbye
]]

Ok. Maybe it ain't gonna work.

[[blocks/test2
left: |

  ## whatever

  This is pretty cool... hum, if it indeed works?

  Ok, and this works?!

  This is me and my cat!
