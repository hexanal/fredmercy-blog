## welcome

I'm a dude who builds things, mostly websites and applications. This is my personal website.

My joy in found in playing with new ideas and in making them come alive with code; and it's especially gratifying when they surprise and stimulate people. For this I try to maximize the *friendliness* of what I build.

Right now, I work as a developer at [Cossette](https://cossette.com), in beautiful Montréal. You can also check out my [résumé](/resume).
