*Welcome,*

<div class="home__section" data-what="yeah">

I'm a dude who builds things, mostly websites and applications. This is my homepage.

</div>

<div class="home__section" data-what="ugh">

I like to play with new ideas and make them come alive with code; I love to surprise and stimulate people by coming up with innovative and friendly interactions.

</div>

<div class="home__section" data-what="thats-right">

Right now, I work as a developer at [Cossette](https://cossette.com), in beautiful Montréal. You can also check out my [résumé](/resume).

</div>

<div class="home__section" data-what="come-on-now">

My programming style is loose and flexible and I try to code in whatever I can code in, you know? This is my personal website + [blog](/blog), and it's a window into [my mind](/this-dude).
