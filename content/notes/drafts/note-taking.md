## what is it?

Technically, *this* is a note. To me, note taking is:

- writing spontaneously;
- sort of freely;
- about any subject;
- as a way to develop an idea, or:
- just to write!

Is it new to me? To be honest, yes! I mean, I've always kept notes, sometimes I've kept diaries of sorts. However, I never reflected on the how and why I did it, until recently, because there seems to be a lot of interest out there for note taking. I wanna be in on it!

## as a developer

Keeping track of what was done and how: it's crucial to document everything we can get away with when working as a developer. After ten years, you'd think I would have learned that fact many meteor showers ago! Only now am I discovering how powerful of a tool *writing* is, especially when developing ideas, thinking about stuff, and... for research! My girlfriend being a researcher, my interest for the scientific method and love for anything sciencey has been supercharged: now I see how it's really made. Writing is **the way**.

As developers we often say ”I'm writing code“, which is okay to say I guess. Though, without pointing any fingers, I've met plenty of devs who either couldn't write for shit, or just didn't really care about writing in a regular old language, and who considered documentation-writing to be a chore and a bore.<sup data-note="they would all agree that writing very good documentation is primordial in this business! just don't ask them to write it">[*]</sup>

## it's a brain add-on

Writing a lot of notes is like doing a brain-dump; saving your progress and writing the RAM onto disk, to use a very nerdy analogy. I never felt like I wasted my time taking notes: it feels good to free up some brain power, it reassures me to know that this stupid idea I had is now described in a few words.

## how i do it

- I use Markdown
- I use vim or VSCodium, because it's the writing interfaces I use the most every day
- I organize that stuff in folders; when it's a lot of related notes, I slap on a **timestamp on the filename**, like `2020-12-07-whatever.md` and I'm done
- most of the random notes, the “brain dump” notes, etc. are written in list form: because I like to **indent sub-ideas** for easier parsing (when revisiting them)
- don't bother with good grammar: the note should represent your idea as you envision it, as you feel it. Even if it's with vulgar slang, written as a metaphor, in another language, using emojis, in ALL CAPS... I don't give a shit how, just write it down, you fuck!
- it's rarely on paper, unless it's a drawing or a diagram
- I built a static website generator to allow these markdown files to be web-ready (I've named it *zorg* for the time being but uhhhh... it's not final!)
