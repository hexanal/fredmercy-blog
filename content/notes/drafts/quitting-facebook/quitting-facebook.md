## how i got on it

I remember vividly when I first heard of Facebook and opened an account on it. It was 2007, I was still a student in France, I was reading some nerdy book about black holes when a German dude started asking me about it. We had a cool conversation: he was traveling around the world with a friend of his, and I was a bit skeptical of his story so he said “add me on Facebook, you'll see!”

Facebook was new to me, but not to my friends. Although I spent a lot of time on the internet, I had never of it, and yet most of my *offline* friends were already on it. Weird!

First thing I hated about it was the fact that, for some reason, people decided it was a good idea to start using their real name to create an account. Okay, why not. Also, the interface was drab and lifeless, especially if you compare it with the insanity of its main competitor at the time, MySpace. It's not to say I loved MySpace, but it was a lot more personal, and quirky, and all over the place. Facebook was rigid.

Anyways. It took me ten years of using it, of adding people on it, posting on it, of reading stupid status update from **EVERYBODY**, of feeling wrong about it, before I decided to leave the platform. To explain, let me backtrack to the moment I felt like something was up:

It seems obvious to us now that Facebook is poison but back in 2012, most people were happily using Facebook and its apps without fear that their addiction to the platform might steer them towards wherever the platform *wanted* them to go. It reminds me of an argument that two friends had over what *the Facebook algorithm* was<sup data-note="An argument which was never resolved because both understood different things when they hear “algorithm”">[1]</sup>: one of them said that there was an algorithm that made Facebook what it is. At the time, I was like “it's not so much an algorithm, but rather a way of building their network”. Nowadays, I would say that there is a *Facebook algorithm*, which is the way they set everything up so that you are shown the right ads, get the most pertinent recommendations, read the promoted posts (from the highest bidders), etc.

A shit-ton of people are on Facebook, giving away nuggets of information every time they share stuff. Their interactions build networks that allow the company to serve impossibly well targeted ads... disguised as posts. Mark Zuckerberg, that motherfucker, built a "social" network and used it to sell us bullshit. How are we surprised that it poses a threat to society?

## how i felt manipulated

Remember 2016? It was the U.S. elections again, and I was consuming a lot of media and clicking a bunch of links from Facebook. Dude, that shit almost turned me into a libertarian, I swear! Ask my girlfriend!

The state of the World depressed me, some dumbass TV celebrity was likely to become president, people were hooked on dumb shit, while there's pollution, climate change, social unrest, a widening wealth gap, etc. It felt like the Internet kept me hooked on it while it was wringing out my brain. I'm shitting on Facebook but the other social networks weren't better: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc. all rely on curated *feeds*, sprinkled with advertisement. They can all suck my ass<sup data-note="In 2016, I also watched compilations of funny Vines on YouTube, which was very entertaining indeed, if not incredibly mind-numbing. They were full of highly quotable moments.">[2]</sup>.

## how i left

Early in 2017, I hit the reset button on my life to move halfway across the globe. While pieceing back my life, I decided to leave Facebook behind.

I have never looked back.

## how i cope

- Instead of poisoning my mind with high doses of random bits of information, I tend to sit down, think about what I want to do and then mindfully do that;
- I don't know what my friends are doing unless I meet them or talk to them on the phone, after I made the conscious effort to reach out to them;
- I value the time I spend with my family;
- The world looks great now that I simply observe it my eyes, and not through the shit I read online;
- I do a lot of drugs

## what's next?

- quitting instagram for good
- quitting Twitter
- quitting everything goddamn it
