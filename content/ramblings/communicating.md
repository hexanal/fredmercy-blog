title: Communicating
description: What to communicate with/through?

I wish to talk to my friends. I also want to talk to people who “aren't good with computers.”

Let's talk about communication. As humans, we love to communicate, to bond with one another, to share thoughts and ideas, make plans, etc.

Recently, I have decided to leave the major social networks behind. I couldn't leave all of them because that would mean losing the connection I've established with many great friends.

In my mind, there is something **terribly wrong** with some of the social networks we engage with:

1. they fulfill a very basic need which is the need to feel “connected”. That's a very good thing, except when it's not! To use a dumb analogy: fast food restaurants fulfill our very basic need for tasty burgers, yet they absolutely do not care whether we adopt healthy consumption habits. In fact, they use every trick in the book to keep us coming back for more!
2. the biggest social networks are simply advertisements delivery systems, whose algorithms are fed by its own users. I don't know about you but I personally CAN'T. FUCKING. STAND. ADS. If the _raison d'être_ of a website is to lure me on it, using my own friends as bait, so that they can blast me with targeted ads, this website can go **fuck itself**.

_ugh!_ I want to talk to all of you, and hear what you have to say, but it won't be on platforms that rely on tracking, on spying, on collecting metadata, or even on hacking the attention of its users.

I guess what I'm trying to say is: I'm _lonely_.

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="extra content! (+)">

My thoughts on the modern technologies we use to communicate:

* **Phonecalls**
  - voicecalls are old school, but it works almost all the time, anywhere
  - sound quality is not great, and group calls are kind of hard to manage
  - can most probably be spied on!
* **Text messages** aren't very secure either
  - but it's old school, too!
  - very inclusive: if you have a phone, you can send messages!
  - group chats are possible, and work well enough
* **emails**
  - it just works!
  - it's not really adequate for real-time conversations, and email clients are clunky
  - they can easily be secure, when using a provider that enables encryption (like [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for example)
    - who dares change their email address, though? It's worse than changing phone numbers!
    - most people use Google Mail. Among other things, Google specializes in [online advertising technologies (wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) so your emails are basically making Google better at tricking you into clicking on ads. Are we still cool with that?
* **Facebook**? Do I even need to say it? This shit's disgusting. If you're still using their service... _why?_
  - yes it's a network, and all your friends and family are still on it
  - but the network is, again, used to stick the best ads in front of your eager eyeballs; you gonna tell me you're cool with that, too?
* **Whatsapp** is the messenger app that most of my friends use to communicate, _when not using Facebook Messenger_.... but it's still a Facebook company, happily sharing the insights gleaned from spying on your [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) with the Mothership.
* **Twitter** is like public text messages; also, it sprinkles ads in your feed, fucks with your timeline and basically is a cancer on society.
  - but I'm still on Twitter because it's the main place where like-minded people share their insights (more regularly than on their blog, if they have one)
  - I hate it because it kind of killed blogging!
* **Instagram** is toxic, just pure toxicity
* **Zoom**... don't know what to say about this one. The UI is a bit shitty; but it seems full-featured. It's a paid service so I guess... no ads?
  - people do suffer from [zoom fatigue](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=zoom+fatigue) though, which makes it a poor choice of software to build a social network!
  - same with **Google Meet/Duo**, **Skype**, etc.

### are there alternatives?

Of course there are alternatives! Those are the ones I'm looking at right now:

**[Signal](https://www.signal.org/)** Messenger sounds like the best alternative to the other messengers. It has an app for iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and Linux; it's fully encrypted; it's easy to use.[*](It needs access to your contact list, which is always weird, but let's hope it's all encrypted anyway and that nothing fishy is happening.)

As for fully-fledged social networks, like a _Facebook clone_, I've heard of two projects:

**[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social)** is quite popular. It's definitely a classic _Facebook-like_ social network, but it's [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_%28information_technology%29) and open-source. It looks polished and road-tested: there are plenty of thriving communities using it already.

**[Matrix](https://matrix.org/)** is “an open network for secure, decentralized communication”: it's a bit technical, but essentially the goal is to have a solid _protocol_ on which to build a social network.

Let's say you want to use a specific program to chat with because you love its interface: with Matrix, you can, because any application can use the network. It's like emails: you can use Outlook, Apple Mail, GMail, FastMail, etc. and they're all using the same underlying technology, so you can contact anyone who owns an email address. The idea is a great one: Matrix just a new "communication channel" that you can build on top of, instead of having to be constrained to a network owned by a huge company. And it's not just text: there is support for video and voice (and more)

For those interested: this is chronology of what happened in my life that made me think a little harder about these issues:

* In **2017** I deleted my Facebook account. Soon after, I decided I wanted to steer clear from anything made by the big tech companies.
* In **January 2019** I decided to not use Google services anymore. It's also when I launched this blog!
* In **October 2019** I joined the digital team at Cossette and felt a newfound appreciation for the quirks and subtleties of my _craft_. I had been pieceing together incredibly complex things together so that they form usable, intelligible, _engaging_ websites. I wanted to make sense of this complexity; and maybe make it simpler and more accessible? I wanted to cut the bullshit to a minimum.
* In **2020**, I was eagerly waiting for the birth of by daughter when the pandemic was declared. During that down time (and very uncertain time), I thought about my job and how it gave me the tools and knowledge to build something that could alleviate the loss of social contact: I could piece together technologies to help us communicate, or at least entertain us during lockdown.
* In **2021**, I'm still digesting all the new ideas, concepts, philosophies, articles, newsletters, etc. that grabbed ahold of my attention.

Many people worked to build new platforms, trying to mix videochat with a sense of physicality, of motion, of a place. Some are open-sourced protoypes, many are from startups trying to blow up. I even dreamed up my own little app last summer, but lacked the time to work on it.

I don't have the answers, but my wish for the future is a social network that has these features:

* free to use
* easy to use for most people, powerful enough for [power users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user)
* using a minimalist interface (by that I mean, _no branding_)
  - free of ads
  - non-addictive
* widely cross-platform
* keeps all data private and local-first by default; it needs to be clear to the user what gets shared on the network, and to whom (maybe with built-in [traceability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceability))
* if using a recommendation algorithm... it should do it in a transparent way, only when prompted by the user
  - with an interface that allows for tweaking the algorithm to the user's liking
