`10:23am:` Good productivity streak yesterday with that weird comment slot system. Funny how I can be super efficient when it comes to building random stupid things, but when it comes to working on things that will end up with me actually getting paid, I'm utterly unmotivated.

And it's all good to build a blog and fill it with written accounts of how mundane my everyday life is, but at some point I will have to be including artistic things up in this ~~bitch~~! _[note: this blog is censored to avoid offending anyone]_

`11:00am:` Ok, so all through 2018 I've been trying to let the creative juices flow, maybe in vain, but hey, gotta try sometimes and... okay, so I have a few song _sketches_ lying around. On this blog I'll be dropping some of those once in a while, to figure out the best way to deliver content.

Here's a short one: [_langsam_](/files/music/langsam.mp3) ðŸŽµ

This one was recorded in March 2018, when I was still experimenting with my setup. Feel free to use the quirky comment system to give feedback, insult me, or whatever. I have no formal training in music but if you follow this weblog you'll know I _am_ learning!

`2:53pm:` I always set the volume on my Apple laptop to four squares; that's the optimal sound level for me. Is it weird that I have a definitive sound level that I use?

`4:54pm:` Found this cool thing on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), by [Seanitzel](https://www.reddit.com/user/Seanitzel), which allows you to browse pretty much any scale you want along with its associated chords. I think it's pretty sweet: [Musitelligence](https://musitelligence.com)
