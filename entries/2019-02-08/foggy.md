`10:07am:` It's unequivocal that YouTube is the _de facto_ platform for hosting video content so that most people can see it. Certainly there are other solutions out there, but it's more of a pain in the ~~ass~~: hosting it means that you're gonna use up a ton of space, real quick; and uploading it to another service also makes it a tiny bit harder for some users to watch it (on their phone, for instance)

But anyway, here's me, trying music and trying to see if that embed code works on my blog:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkWouhhM9tA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Foggy](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkWouhhM9tA) was the first draft I published on my YouTube channel.

Obviously not the best ever, but I've barely started yet. More to come, hopefully.

`12:48pm:` Fixing the youtube embed so that it doesn't break the layout on mobile devices. Also; the javascript for this blog is taking a long time to compile, and I have many vulnerability alerts... guess I'll have to fix that sooner than later.

The comment system (_Dottyâ„¢_) is still under construction and hasn't been road tested yet. There is a new option to specify the number of dots to use for each post, which might allow more flexibility, let's say if for some reason many people were to leave comments (hahaha!)

`3:34pm:` Done with the javascript compilation issues... _for now!_

`6:57pm:` Going oot.
