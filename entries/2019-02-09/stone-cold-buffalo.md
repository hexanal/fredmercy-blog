`10:12am:` Got to see [King Buffalo (Official website)](https://kingbuffalo.com/) and it was pretty good. If you're into stoner rock/metal/doom/whateve, then definitely check out the title track from their latest [_Longing To Be The Mountain_ (on Bandcamp)](https://kingbuffalo.bandcamp.com/track/longing-to-be-the-mountain)

Also check out one of the guest bands [The Naked High (Bandcamp)](https://thenakedhigh.bandcamp.com/), which a pretty cool local band.

This stuff's trippy.

`10:32am:` Here's a couple of very old boring songs from when I had just acquired some recording gear:

[Infinity Times Infinity](/files/music/infinity-times-infinity.mp3) _(July 1, 2017)_

Win some and lose some
Lose some and then some
Tie up those loose ends

Thirty orbits around
Happiness still unfound
Let's see what you got

Bitterly I comply
On bended knees I cry
Fall in line one last time

Yes I do smile sometimes
Who knows why I do?
Only human after all...

[It's an honor](/files/music/its-an-honor.mp3) _(December 20, 2017)_

It's an honor
To be here
