`9:08am:` Spending some time trying new things for this blog: new colorscheme, new icons, and maybe something different with the archive section. I'm not even sure I need one: I could stick **all** of the entries on the homepage, and have an anchor system to jump to each month, with like a dropdown or something?! That's something to explore.

As for the blog's colors, at first I wanted to make it a little bit warmer, a little different, you know? but coming back to that almost pure blue looks way cooler. It's a bit cheeky geeky, but I like it and I guess it fits a little better.
