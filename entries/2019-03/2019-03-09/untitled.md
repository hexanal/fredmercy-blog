description: Everyday chores, every day bores

`12:22pm:` Always gotta do administrative chores, walking about in the wind for hours, solving problems you didn't know you had, or problems you willingly created for yourself. But anyway, it's important to stay chipper, and never lose confidence, etc.

Sometimes it's just too much, you know... having to bottle all of the frustration. Having to roll with the punches, always feeling grateful for what I have. It's cool. Yet sometimes, I really just want to feel something else than that; like true confidence, true peace. Feeling like I'm taking back control over shit. These days shit is flying straight towards the fan, and having to run around catching it before the collision gets exhausting.

`4:45pm:` Ok. All done for today I guess, unless something pops up from nowhere.
