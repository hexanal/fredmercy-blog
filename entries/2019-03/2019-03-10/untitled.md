description: Picking up new reading material
type: journal

`7:52pm:` A literal walk in the park today, through the wind and rain. Visited a bookshop and picked up much needed [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) [material](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3188964-the-doors-of-perception), because I just finished reading [A Brief History of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time) (Goodreads links).

I regret yesterday's entry's tone. It was a bit brooding and gloomy, but I suppose I have to accept life's lows along with its highs.
