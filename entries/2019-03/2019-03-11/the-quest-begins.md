`7:40am:` Sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the uncharacteristically blue sky; I'm thinking about how hectic the last few weeks have been while at the same time how little I've been able to achieve. But, everything in due time, I suppose.

Things don't look half bad right now, and this week is full of promises. I need lords to allow me to slave away all week to make them more prosperous, so that when the gold coins spill over, I can amass them and afford sustenance.

`7:49am:` Eventually I will try to incorporate more fun things in this blog. Maybe some day it'll get to a point where I'm comfortable sharing it to the world! (no it's not live... haven't shared the link yet!)

Speaking of... here are today's links!:

- [Naked Lunch (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102511): I've had that movie saved for years (!) and finally watched it a couple of days ago. That's the Cronenberg I know and love! I can't believe it took me this long to see this one... wait, let me drop another link right now...
- [Scanners (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081455): also watched this one not too long ago! The quintessential eighties movie. For a guy who grew up watching [The Hidden](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093185), [Robocop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870), [The Fly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064), [The Terminator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247), etc. this one felt like “the one who got away”! I mean, it's perfect.

`9:17am:` We usually consider devices that try to do more than one thing as being mediocre at all the things they do. But nowadays our cellphones do so many things they ended up replacing our cameras, calendars, newspapers, voice recorders, maps (and GPS), televisions, calculators, etc.

What I think we gain in convenience, practicality, and productivity, we lose in physicality, purposefulness, and mindfulness. At the risk of sounding like an old degenerate, I think having a specific device for each use-case makes the user much more involved with the process. I see this virtualization of our physical devices as a first step towards full acceptance of the coming “virtual reality” revolution: get people used to _apps_, so that when they're pulled into an ever more virtual world, the idea of replacing physical objects with their digital counterparts will seem very normal, and commonplace. Why own art, candles, a TV, a guitar?... hell, why even have windows and lightbulbs?! Put on your goggles and slip into a bright new world!

The ultimate down-sizing: objects are broken down to bits, and their digital ersatz are fed back to us!

_Ahem._ Sorry about that. It's probably better to refer to authors who have thought longer and harder about all this... I guess what I'm saying is: I'm scared of the future, because of how boring it might be. But as someone keeps telling me: there's no use in being pessimistic. Being hopeful and ready to face the day is the best attitude to adopt.

`9:56am:` Dear Future Reader,

If you haven't noticed already, most of the entries in this blog are the _stream-of-consciousness_ ramblings of a confused nerd. When you see a timestamp next to a paragraph, it means that the content of this new paragraph doesn't nicely follow the previous one: it's a new idea, a _non-sequitur_.

Thank you for your understanding.

`3:57pm:` Made it back home, I took the bus for the first time in this city. Since it was the middle of the afternoon, it was almost empty but I assume it gets crowded during the classic commuting hours. We'll see how it goes! What a beautiful day it was, too! I feel great.
