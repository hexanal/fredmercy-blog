`8:56am:` Early update this morning... as I'm just waiting on getting the necessary gear to tap into the network again.

For such a short time, forgoing an _uncapped_ home connection to the internet proved quite difficult, and it felt like I had to force myself to sit still, crack open a book, and read. I think this tells me I have an addiction to the internet, and should find ways to allow offline time once in a while because I'm convinced it's beneficial to the mind. Withdrawal is a real thing, and the lack of offline habits made it hard to turn to something else to _pass the time_.

`11:08am:` Half a second into the process and I already have to contact support. First impression matters!

`11:19am:` I'm mad as hell, but I just saw a guy picking all the trash that's lying around in my street, probably for [#trashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trashtag)! Thank you for this, young man, it fills me with joy! (but telecom companies **still fucking suck!**)

`3:30pm:` Internet? Today? Yeah, naw. Check again tomorrow.

`9:14pm:` Check again Friday! Ugh... I guess by then I'll have finished reading all those books (which is pretty cool, actually). Side effects of internet addiction withdrawal: I think about how to better my existence a little more, I think about my family and friends a little more, I reach out to my friends and family more... I think it's pretty cool.

`10:56pm:` Third gin & tonic; obviously I've been replacing one addiction with another again.

`12:33am:` Technically we're tomorrow but fuk it... psshhhyeah whatever. no internet means I get to listen to the mp3 I have on my computer, which means I get to listen to Tool! (which isn't on Spotify yet) Oh fuck yeah it's good!

`12:45am:` [...]

`1:03am:` At that point I'm just letting go guys... Listening to [Shaper](https://www.last.fm/music/Shaper) now (I have no idea how I got into that artist in the first place, but it's pretty good!)
