`1:49pm:` I'm gonna try and get a _githook_ to update my blog automatically whenever I push code to my repository. Somehow I never took the time to figure this out before, but if I can manage to make it work, that'd be pretty sweet! Wish me luck!

`1:56pm:` Ok, first test failed, but whatever. I'll try something else.

`2:14pm:` I mean... still nothing, but maybe soon.
