`8:22am:` Feeling quite miserable at the moment, for a variety of reasons, [probably because it's overcast today](/blog/2019-03-25/sun-power/). It's as though I'm starting everything again, but like, I bumped the difficulty level up one notch and I'm still struggling with the first stage!

`10:35am:` Second cup of coffee today and I'm back on track. I just needed a little pick-me-up. And the clouds are parting a little, too.

`11:45am:` Watched [Chocolat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241303/reference) with the girlfriend the other day. What a cute little movie! I rate it: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I don't really know what the moral of the story is, or anything, but I quite enjoyed it.
