`2:09pm:` Maybe it's stupid in some ways, but I wanted to have my own little list of pretty pictures that's _not_ hosted on the leading “square-pictures-with-filters” social media platform. So I went ahead and added a new section called [Photofeed](/blog/photofeed) where I'll dump pictures once in a while.
