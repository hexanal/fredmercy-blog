`9:34am:` Managed to go through April Fool's relatively unscathed, although it's not especially hard when you barricade yourself inside your house, and cut all contact with the outside world!

Man, I wish I had something interesting, something badass to talk about, to share with y'all. Truth of the matter is, folks, is that I've got nothing today. I'm figuring out my gear, getting used to my piano, learning music theory, trying to get my thoughts in order, my life in order, my _affairs_ in order. I managed to go for a run this morning to get the juices flowing, so my energy levels are higher than usual, that's good. My reason for running is almost only to get the runner's high. Weight loss isn't a concern, and I suppose general fitness is a goal, but not as important and vital to me as the mental boost I get from it. I mean, it's no surprise and no news to anyone at that point that [exercizing helps with depression](http://tlc.ku.edu/elements) (among other things) so this is what I'm doing.

`9:49am:` Time for a link. This song right here, [Worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drzzGClaEKU), by [Bongripper](https://www.bongripper.com/), is one on my favorite doom metal songs. Super long, drawn out, but with a dramatic mood change mid-song. Minimal and desolate. Simply excellent!

`1:25pm:` Starting on some _coding!_ yeah!

`4:53pm:` Woah. Spent some time on this! Well _whoop dee doo!_

`9:50pm:` And still at it? Nah, dude, gotta take a break sometime...!
