description: Will I ever get back to making music and loving it?

`2:19pm:` It took a while to realize it, but I brought my [Zoom H5](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h5-handy-recorder) from overseas and this little boy doubles as an audio interface, which means I'll be able to record stuff a bit more easily in Ableton Live. So, yup, I now have zero excuse to not at least _try_ to compose stuff!

Still missing audio cables, but since it already sports a microphone, I can at least use that to sketch out ideas. I originally bought it to record ambient sounds, as a field recorder, and I might also do some of that. Maybe this will happen before there's any music landing on here. There **will** be music on here, I promise. Eventually.
