`2:59pm:` And yet another [colorscheme](https://coolors.co/ff6c23-a46bea-f9eaea-ffdd21-65b25e) change. I decided to go for a rather warm “sunset” palette, which I find very relaxing and... yeah, _warm_. Let's see if this one sticks for a longer period of time!

I liked it so much that I also updated the main site to use it. It's a bit feminine, especially compared to the very minimal and spartan “black, white and neon” theme I was using before, but I really wanted a more colorful theme, and this one's really cool, I think.
