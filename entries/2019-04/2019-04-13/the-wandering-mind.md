`7:51pm:` Eventually, I will need to try and produce something, anything. Just get the ball rolling, start something. Too much time to think isn't ideal; what's ideal is having time to dedicate oneself wholly to a hobby, to a given goal, or a project.

Right now I'm dancing around, trying to find my place. I'm stretching, trying to a most comfortable position, like a cat digging its paws in a pillow for far longer than necessary — and seemingly for no reason. I find myself doing things that are absolutely not related to the goals I had previously set for myself. I find myself changing my mind overnight. Nothing in my life seems to point to any particular direction, my life-plan an abstract painting of a flowchart diagram, full of recursion, dead-ends, overlap, and no visible end point.

Even writing about it doesn't help; if anything, it actually makes it slightly worse by reminding me that, not only do I *not* use this blog the way I had intended to use it, but I'm using it to write at length about _how I'm not using it correctly_.

Another meta-frustration.

`8:13pm:` Enough self-pity! Here's one link for y'all, if you're into science and technology, and space, physics, etc. I really recommend Sean Carroll's [“Mindscape”](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) podcast.

The topics tackled are always fascinating, the guests are interesting, the pace is good, the duration not too crazy, the editing solid. I rate it a full ★★★★★

`9:37pm:` _oof!_ So I guess I gotta get used to it: another thing I really _really_ wanted to have was denied to me. It's cool, you know... “you can't always get what you want!”

Still though, it's doesn't help my chronic case of _hopelessness_!

There, there... it'll be okay, “[remember and the spirits will collide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdHJurX0yVA)”.

It's just that [i wanna go home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjUOJEXiX3g)...
