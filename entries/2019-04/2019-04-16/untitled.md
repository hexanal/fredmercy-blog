`5:37pm:` Looks like I messed up the formatting on my two previous entries, so I went ahead and fixed that. Serves me right to try and edit the posts using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with word-wrapping enabled!

Not much more to add; I've been working on a job since last week, so that kept my mind busy on something. I've also made decisions and settled on some medium-term plan for the next two months, which is a relief, although I can't make out nothing much clearer after that. I'll certainly remain _in a state of flux_ for quite a while unless something happens that crystallizes this whole mess into one solid blob.

`5:45pm:` Y'all... did you watch the [Game of Thrones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947) season premiere?! I sure did, and honestly, I think I remembered a good 30% of the characters and their names...! not bad!
