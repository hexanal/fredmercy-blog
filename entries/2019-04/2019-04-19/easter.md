`7:49am:` It's Good Friday. I'm not a Christian, but having been brought up in a culture dominated by the religion, I suppose it's easy for me to observe the tradition somewhat. So I went and bought salmon, because one thing I remember is that we're supposed to eat fish on Good Friday.

Man, this blog is really turning into a shit-show. Truth is, I've been working on [some nerdy shit](${base_url}/2019-04-12/untitled) to heat up the engine, and I'll get right on to building/creating/inventing something.

`8:06am:` Last night (or, _yesterday afternoon_ for the country involved) the US government dropped the [Mueller Report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf), and I was like “Finally!”, and then I went to sleep because this shit ain't my problem. I got invested in the scandals, maybe two years ago, because of my geographic proximity with the country, and I didn't want to see it be further divided, hurt, or ridiculed. But these days, I literally have other fish to fry.

Still, it'd be good to see something somewhat positive come out of all this. Some accountability, some justice. Some _excitement_!.

`3:20pm:` I don't know about y'all, but those blurry floating balls on the right side of the website are actually sucking up so much CPU/GPU that my macbook is almost immediately huffing and puffing, struggling to make it smooth. So, I'm gonna have to revise that design decision and come up with something way way simple.

`3:42pm:` Alright; I still wanted to have those colors in there, so now it's just a gradient! Hope you like it. Might change it later, I don't know.
