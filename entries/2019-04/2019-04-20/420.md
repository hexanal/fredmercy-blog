`10:42am:` No hitting the herbs for me today, but instead I was a little bit productive: I went ahead and redesigned my Instagram-like [photofeed](${base_url}/photofeed/) section because I wasn't 100% satisfied with the UI. So now it's just a long list of images, loaded when scrolling them in view. That way I just spit all of the them on the page but I don't hog your connection forever trying to download all of them at once. I think it's cool.

I went a bit crazy with the styles and all that; I'm just experimenting. Somehow my laptop is fucking *struggling* with it because of the animations, transitions, _mix blend modes_ involved in that design.

Honestly, it's such a pain to update it right now, and I take pictures so rarely that I might just shelf that bitch up in the coming month. But! I've got other ideas... what's missing is content. Just good content, you know.

`3:10pm:` Boom. I love animating stuff, so there you go: you've got a cool animated gradient bar on the left there. On mobile it's on the bottom, and it looks too much like a loading/progress bar so I'm not super sure about it, but whatever, I ain't gonna do no A/B testing!

`9:19pm:` Oh shit, I guess I'm moving again. Heck!
