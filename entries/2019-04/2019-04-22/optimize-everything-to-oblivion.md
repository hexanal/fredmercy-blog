`9:35am:` It's sort of refreshing to read something like this article on Medium, that I found on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)<sup title="This is my go-to when I feel sick of mindlessly browsing Reddit but I still need to waste some time reading about anything at all. It's a bit more stimulating to the mind also, and gets me riled up enough to write something in here! So that's cool, that's what I want, that's what feels right.">[1]</sup>, entitled [“The Efficiency Delusion”](https://onezero.medium.com/the-efficiency-delusion-f6a97241e1e1).

These days I sort of struggle with this idea of plugging in technology — often in the form of an app, a website, a service, a subcription — to try and make life _easier_, more _efficient_... more _streamlined_, whatever that means? And the problem is mentioned in the article: it's that this little bit of efficiency boost is used to get us to “do more real work”, and more often, for longer... which basically means making life more difficult, right?

The Modern World is a mindfuck. It's a sensory overload, and motherfuckers are out there boasting about their meditation sessions, their _mindfulness_... heck, some of them are microdosing psychedelics because it makes them more creative when solving problems at their stupid fucking yuppie start-up job. Man, nowadays, if you manage to give yourself twenty minutes of quiet respite a day, that's an incredible feat and a _lifehack_. Get the fuck out of here with your obvious shit.

`9:49am:` This blog is somewhat optimized, in a way, so that I don't have to do much copy-pasting. **BUT**, it's also not really efficient and super advanced. The process is actually tedious. Here's the breakdown of the process of writing and publishing a new entry:

1. duplicate a past entry folder, change the date, change the title;
2. edit the content, setting all the timestamps manually because it really isn't something that needed automating or whatever, I ain't about keeping that as a data-point, you know?
3. then, when I'm down editing, I check it out on my local server; and push to the Github repository
4. then, I have to log in to my server via _ssh_, pull the changes, and build the blog again on the server

Not too much work, but a far cry from the super easy process most writers are used to, usually consisting of drafting a post in a cool looking Content Management System interface, and then simply hitting “Publish”!

You know what though? I like it that way. It's my little inefficient artisanal website. It's my own.
