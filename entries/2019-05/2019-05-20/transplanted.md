`11:10am:` It's tough to keep the energy on “high” all the time, to be motivated and creative every day, but I think the culprit is... bro, it ain't me: the culprit is the modern internet, man.

There's fucking YouTube with its endless stream of short videos designed to get you hooked, algorithm-powered recommendations to get you hooked on *new* shit, podcasts and streams and all that time-wasting bullshit.

There's Twitter... do I even fucking need to describe that one? It's Death by a Million Brainfarts. It's a literal dawn chorus from the most fucked up jungle you can imagine, where some birds come to chirp and sing off-key just to piss off the rest.

There's Reddit, that drowns you in so much information about so many unrelated topics that you end up learning nothing, feeling dumber for not having focused on anything for even a minute...

Then there's Hacker News, which I've been browsing a little more consistently lately, and it ain't *TOO* bad, really, but it's still very similar to Reddit. An avalanche of links, each one light years away from the last in terms of topic, tone, length, etc.

I keep thinking I need to cut those off of my life, cold turkey, and start thinking about what the fuck I'm doing.

`11:59am:` Of course, I don't have any serious project going on. I'm too busy getting my shit together in this life: moved back to homebase, got health issues to resolve quick, got money issues, got friends to reconnect with, etc. I keep thinking: “man, once this is over with, I'll be able to get shit done”, but I'm lying to myself. Shit ain't gonna be done, ever.

Not before I get rid of the things that suck the time out of my days, man! These sites stick a needle in my brain, scramble it up and suck it out my nose like I'm getting mummified. I feel dumb, trapped, locked-in, enslaved, powerless, lazy.

I need to make shit. I need to meet people who make the same shit. I need to make even more shit with other people. I need to feel like I use my time *wisely*.
