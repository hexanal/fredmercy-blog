`1:08pm:` Today was all about getting shit done: all the administrative bullshit that was hanging over me, all easy stuff, but stuff I don't particularly want to tackle yet. Getting a few goodies, enjoying the sunny day.

I now have an acoustic guitar and some new strings. Time to learn. Time to feel humble for a while. But it's also time to experiment with some shit, my dude! This is it.

`1:36pm:` I'm gonna start writing a longer piece for this blog, kind of a longform article about a topic close my heart. Whatever; I don't know. I'll get to it when it feels right.

Hey, if you're reading this, do me a favor and close your laptop, phone, tablet or desktop monitor, and go for a walk. Find the closest park, and go for a walk. Better yet, grab a real book, sit on a bench at the park, and read.

If the weather's bad... meh, okay, stay home and watch Netflix or something, who cares. I still love you.

`5:28pm:` Practice what you preach: I'm off to the park.
