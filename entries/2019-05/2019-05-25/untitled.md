description: The tedium of updating; should I turn to Twitter?
type: journal

`9:50am:` I'm not very conscientious with this blog update process; it's a bit tedious, as I [mentioned in a past entry](${base_url}/2019-04-22/optimize-everything-to-oblivion/#@9:49am), which is fine because it's just a small blog and nobody reads it, but I'm thinking about when I'll want to update it on the go, or more often... maybe I should find a better way to publish updates.

I'm in a very transitory period of my life right now, which doesn't lend itself to being super creative, but that's just a bullshit excuse to slack off continuously, I think. I could definitely get going from now on.

`9:59am:` The very disturbing paradox in the way things are managed in this adult life these days is that I want to put the emphasis in organically stumbling upon things, go through life a little more like... floating, down the stream, you know? ... but at the same time, there's so much bullshit to tackle that I now have to keep a handful of checklists that I revisit anxiously every now and then.

Why would we fill ourselves full of dread that way? Don't we all know what to do, and when to do it, instinctively? Why keep lists? Why tether ourselves to some words jotted down in a managerial frenzy?

I'm rebelling against the rigidity of this life. Programming already offers a career filled with rules and constraints; there's no way I'm gonna let the rest of my time be "programmed".
