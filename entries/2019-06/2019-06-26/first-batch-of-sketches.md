`10:13am:` It's been a long time since the last update, I sort of gave up trying to have a very frequent update pattern and also I really thought I would have more interesting things to share, but I guess *not*.

Lately, I've been busy working and also I don't have my own place yet, so it was difficult to get installed properly, you know, and have a setup that's ready for when I've got an inspiration rush! But I've tried my hand at composing using only the field recorder I bought a while back, and that new acoustic guitar.

I probably should start with more covers so that I broaden my palette a little faster, and figure out how actual songs are structured. Right now I could only focus on... what? like, a verse, an intro, maybe something like a chorus or a hook? nothing I've done can be described as a song yet, so that's my challenge for the future: to compose something with a classic structure of verses + refrain + bridge.

*But, hey — enough of my yakin'! Whaddaya say? Let's boogie!*

All I've ever wanted
was to sing my song
was to sing any song

Not even to be heard
just to sing a song

If I have no future then I don't need no past
If you don't give me another chance

Then I'll come to claim it for myself

Really makes you wonder:
“am I better off alone?”

Makes you stop and think:
“is it best to be on your own?”

Not at all built to wander
not as a lone soul anyway
Unless you're cast away
trying to find your way back home
trying to find your way back home...

Any part of this

Just wish you were here
Instead of so far

'cause it kind of sucks
That you are so far

Please keep me in mind while you are all the way around the world
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woo!
