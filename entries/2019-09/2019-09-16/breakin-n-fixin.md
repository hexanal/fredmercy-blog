`8:53am:` If it ain't broke, don't fix it; but if you don't like it, break it *then* fix it. Why should we put up with the *status quo*? I should be fine with breaking things.

Anyway, how are y'all doing? Good? Glad to hear that.

`9:09am:` Github keeps telling me my packages have security vulnerabilities and it seems all I do these days is fix those issues... crazy maintenance job, man!  And now I'm hitting a roadblock where the only way I'll fix them is by rewriting the whole page templating strategy I'm using for something more up-to-date. And, man... to be honest, I really don't want to have to do that.

Don't know how many times I've typed "fix" in this entry, but I bet it's a lot.

ain't I'm out. peace
