title: Tech Will Ruin My Life
description: Ranting about some shit
type: rant

`7:14am:` “Don't go grocery shopping when you're hungry”, and also “Don't expect anything technology-related to work the first time”

Listen up people: I have been around, and I have been using high-tech gear my whole life. Born in 1987, so I ain't too young, but computers started getting reaaaally mainstream when I was around, what, ten? and the internet basically became a household utility by the time I turned fifteen.

And it has always kind of sucked. I mean, it's a young-as-heck industry so of course you can't expect it to be flawless, but all I'm saying is: with all the bullshit apps, and startups, and eco-system, and infrastructure, computer engineers, all that is “silicon valley-ish”, etc. trying their very best to make it better (supposedly), it's still falling short for many people, and for many uses.

I'm ranting, and i'm tired, it's hot, it's late, I'm hungry. And these days it seems whenever I find some window of time where I'm able to work on my small projects, it makes me angry because it almost always goes wrong.
