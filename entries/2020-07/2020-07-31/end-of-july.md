`11:15pm:` Took a little time tonight to revive the old blog.

Thinking about what technology to use to make version 2 of the blog has kept me
up at night. My wish is to combine its codebase with that of the main website
(fredmercy.ca), and reboot both of them. Ideas are coming at me at lightspeed,
but time is severely lacking.

This time, I don't necessarily want to use React and open its ecosystem
can-of-worms, or Pandora' Box, or whatever the idiom is. We're just talking
about some html, some js here and there, plain old, good CSS, etc.

VueJS might be a fit; I've been toying with Hyperapp lately; maybe I could use
Svelte but I would be on my own for pretty much anything... which might actually
be something that will entice me to it?! But I hate to think I have to write
something else that HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I want minimalism; I want short & sweet; I wanna Keep It Super Simple.

Maybe I will keep a diary of my quest on this blog (which will hopefully become
the "old blog" soon enough) and that way that will motivate me? Or maybe it will
show me how little I get to work on that darn thing!

Anyway, love you all; you're great!
