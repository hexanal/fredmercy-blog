`3:12pm:` While at work and frustrated, I'm tempted to vent on my blog. After
all, this might be its only use these days and the days past.

It's probably the reason why this frustration is surging back in full force: we
are getting pummeled by some invisible force, our society's deep flaws are now
showing, summer is now halfway done and we are eager, man, we are EAGER to GET
SHIT MOVING... meanwhile nothing of real value gets done, it seems.

Days like these make me wonder if I should hop back on those meds, man. Isn't
that sad? I'm getting worked up so much over some bullshit that I feel like I'm
(almost literally) going crazy...

- The blog? haven't worked on it yet.
- Music? nothing since the new year. I know, it's **FUCKED**. _**UP**_.
- Life? still good, baby girl good, health... good?
- Other projects? gathering dust
- Work? horrendous
