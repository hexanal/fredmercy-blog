`1:32pm:` What will I do today? I'll try to figure out whether VueJS is a good
candidate to help me build a goddamn website efficiently. I need this website to
be _light_, I need it to be _to the point_, and _efficient_. So I'm checking
whether VueJS can compile that javascript starter kit and keep it under... 80KB?

`1:37pm:` See, I really don't want to start using a framework that can't
give me a minified package that weighs less than 146.52KB; and don't give me
that gzipped size metric I don't give a fuck about, bro. I keep my eyes on the
prize, which is some javascript code that only does what it FUCKING NEEDS TO.

`1:48pm:` Out of laziness, or maybe to be more productive, I might just choose
React, and maybe try my hand at some Server-Side Rendering. But, as I mentioned
earlier: the package needs to be **small**.

I'm no stranger to overkill because the very simple website hosted
on fredmercy.ca is still powered by a React app.

`2:12pm:` Then again if the goal is to produce the smallest filesize possible,
maybe I should consider Svelte and get real nerdy with that one? It's new, it's
weird, it's minimal; maybe it's what I need?

`2:14pm:` I'm thinking of not sleeping anymore to try and work on my
side-projects at night so that I won't be bothered by the normal events of daily
life. Apparently, it's lethal to be sleep-deprived for too long: win-win!

`2:20pm:` So tired and hot and angry that I don't want to go on working on this
blog today. This project is inches away from being thrown into the garbage bin.
I just don't have the fucking energy nor the time.

More updates later I guess...
