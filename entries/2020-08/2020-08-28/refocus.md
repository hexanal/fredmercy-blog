`3:55pm:` Ok so, in light of the previous entries it's fair to say I've been getting increasingly frustrated by this blog-overhaul process and so I've decided to start really slow and small: I'll setup a *beta* version of the blog for live-testing purposes, and I will build it to be as simple and straightforward as I can.

Nothing fancy, but I will add to it, bit by bit, little by little. Just like the kid I'm raising, folks... I guess I have to crawl before I walk!

Also, I have a ton of other projects that I'm putting on the backburner while this is taking so much goddamn time; keeping it simple will help me jump on those, once in a while.
