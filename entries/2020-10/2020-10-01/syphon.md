`10:07am:` With all my attention being captured by my newborn daughter, it has been difficult to focus on music, this blog, or life in general. Somehow, I am grateful to have been given this time of incredibly deep reflection, in this time of deep turmoil. I don't pretend to know the answers, but I like to write out my feelings on this blog, maybe as a way to keep a trace of my (and our?) state of mind.

First of all, if you're reading this: you're awesome!

What I mean is that we're all in this together, and there's no _deus ex machina_ waiting to jump in to save us from this bitter drama. We're human beings, we have neighbors, friends, family. We have jobs, some of us have good jobs which we enjoy and pay good money. We need to keep together, and share that wealth.  Nothing fucks me up more than seeing people adopt a mentality of individualism, of greed... those people won't go far. And they need to be shown the light.

Last year it took all I had to keep it together psychologically. I can't even begin to think about going through this ordeal with as fragile a spirit as I had in October 2019. What changed? A perspective change? Becoming a father? Landing a good job, and working with good people? It probably helped.

I'm still optimistic because I want to believe that, deep down, most of us will follow science, and will try to do the best we can. We need to be calm, get off social media, and nourish our brains with healthy bits and habits. These days our minds are under attack, as some entities (corporations? politicians? governments? lobby groups? I don't give a fuck who) weaponize the Internet for their own gains; I love the web, but we need to claim it back for ourselves. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and many other companies hell-bent on making profits off the backs of the common people... we don't need them. We fucking don't. At this point, the wonderful, magical capabilities of the tools they offer do not outweigh what I would call the "hidden costs" of using them.

And this is coming from someone whose livelihood depends on these companies! But frankly, this isn't what I signed up for... but I'm one guy. How do we fight back? How do we turn the tide? Am I a tired old bourgeois hipster who doesn't know what he's talking about? YES! AND I'M NOT ALONE, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON! *NOBODY!*
