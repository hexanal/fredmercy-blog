`10:13am:` Some little time alone, and I want to start writing some shit on this blog!

These days, it almost feels like I'm going back to school, back to my early years of wonder: the World is mysterious, nobody understands it, nobody gives a shit, most people just chugging along, trying their best, etc. and me in the middle, doing the same thing, but maybe also reflecting on what to do, why, how, and feeling *strange* about a lot of stuff. I feel like a kid.

Recently, I've turned a closet into some sort of workstation where I'll be tinkering with all kinds of shit, time permitting of course! And I've equipped myself so that working from home won't feel like I'm locked in a drab prison cell. I have goals, projects, hopes & fears; thankfully, lately I tend to take my fears and turn them into excitement, and I'm super excited to see what I'm gonna do with all of this.

For this blog, I finally gave up on the idea of making it super *evolved*: I want it to be barebone, really old school. Real easy to maintain. I want it to look cool, and feel right, improve the UX, etc. while keeping it absolutely ancient in terms of technology. Ideally, I'm aiming for some plain HTML, CSS, Javascript; with maybe an API on the server to handle all that bullshit with creating pages, comments, etc. It'll still be super basic, but fuck you. I want something simple.

Next, I want to set up some sort of **music** section, where I'll be dumping some track drafts, finished or not, samples, weird experiments, anything. I want this dumb blog to be a hodge-podge of all the crap I'm toying with. It'll be fun.

That's all I'm gonna write today. I still have to push this entry and it's a long process. Ah! I know: in my next entry, I'll write about the Slow Movement!

Take care!
