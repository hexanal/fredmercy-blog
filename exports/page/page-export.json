Read on, then!</p>\n<code class=\"collapse\">\n<button type=\"button\">Toggle the nerd talk ü§ì</button>\n\n<p>Currently, I have to write this shit in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">markdown</a> file and place it in a properly named folder (from where I infer the date and final URL), then I have to rebuild the whole website using <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> from the command line. It&#39;s cool, it works. But it&#39;s sort of clunky, and slow: that&#39;s my fault for having something that rebuilds the whole website every time and there&#39;s a very easy fix for that. I should probably look into it.</p>\n<p>I have to run the <a href=\"https://fredmercy.ca\">main website</a>&#39;s server on my laptop because the blog gets built (the actual html files!) into the <em>blog</em> folder.</p>\n<p>After that, when I&#39;m done writing and the post looks good, I use <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">git</a> to <em>push</em> those changes on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>. Then I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh_(Secure_Shell)\">ssh</a> into my server, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)\">cd</a> into  the right folder, <em>pull</em> the changes, and then run a cool <em>npm run build</em> command to let the website be what it is.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;ve read through that and you&#39;re not too tech inclined and you&#39;re thinking ‚Äúman, this sure looks like a lot of bullshit to go through in order to post blog updates!‚Äù... you&#39;re absolutely right!</p>\n<p>However, I still like it. I like the <em>slowness</em> of it, the intentionality of it. It does the job. In the end I have exactly what is needed, even though it still requires some work (and obviously if you&#39;ve been reading past entries you&#39;ll know that I have this burning desire to make this blog as good as possible, which to me means that it should do the absolute minimum to make the reading experience pleasant)</p>\n<p>Pfew!</p>\n</code>\n\n<p>I had an idea yesterday regarding my blog and the way I will manage its updates. I thought of simply <em>editing HTML directly on the server</em>.</p>\n<p>Crazy, eh? I know. Of course there would be some javascript-powered interaction going on, as always, but the structure would be entirely handled by old me, writing straight HTML, in one file, on the server. It reminds me of how I built one of my first websites! The crazy thing is, since it was just a handful of HTML files, I still have them backed-up somewhere: something I never thought of doing to my numerous Wordpress-powered websites! Those databases are lost in time, victim of the complexity by which they were put together.</p>\n<p>Backing up that bitch would require a single <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol\">secure copy</a> command.</p>\n<p>Of course, this throws a big wrench into my plans of leveraging the AWESOME POWER of NextJS to build a <em>server-side rendered</em>, <em>statically-generated</em>, <em>progressively-enhanced</em>, <em>cybernetically-doped</em> website.</p>\n<p>But frankly, I&#39;m not trying to compete with Medium right here.

It was quite illuminating to force myself to do this because I new know what all the necessary parts are.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve started the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a> tutorial pages, and I will see if it solves my problems. The code already looks similar to my solution, so it&#39;s encouraging. A few years ago when I first tested it, it didn&#39;t quite fit. There were issues with page transitions not being easily implemented, and you <em>KNOW</em> I want those sweet transition animations!! (but I&#39;ll keep &#39;em short &amp; schweet)</p>\n<p>Concerns are plenty, though:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I&#39;m very uneasy about using a turnkey solution from a <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">company</a></li>\n<li>Not sure whether it will match my way of doing things (although I can probably wrestle with NextJS to make it work!)</li>\n<li>Will it stand the test of time?</li>\n<li>What about performance? Static generation is cool, but is the frontend package going to be <em>small</em> enough?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answers in the next few episodes.</p>\n<p><code>11:45am:</code> Speaking of episodes, I have had <em>zero</em> time to binge on shows, not even discover new YouTube videos. As we&#39;re easing into the colder seasons, my focus is into reading. About tech shit, of course, but also about another huge interest of mine: space.</p>\n<p>And obviously, I have a passion for writing. It may not be interesting, but I like it: it appeases the mind. Eventually if I get better at this and other things, I might share more, and maybe try to gain in visibility. For now however, I&#39;m very happy with tending my own semi-private garden and writing about nothing and everything.</p>\n<p><code>4:54pm:</code> Good day today: managed to make some progress on the NextJS experiment.

I can&#39;t get used to it. My pinky can only do so much, between tabs, the left shift key, the backtick &amp; tilde... it just didn&#39;t work for me. I know, I know, this is full-nerd territory, but I read in many places that this is something developers do and I wanted to finally try it. meh.</li>\n<li>Switched to using the <a href=\"https://juliamono.netlify.app/\">JuliaMono</a> font.

Now I can take it slow, and start working on some great shit!</p>\n<p>At the end of yesterday&#39;s entry, I mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.slowmovement.com/\">Slow Movement</a>, something I&#39;m starting to explore. At the risk of sounding really hypocritical, I believe that we should consume less. Right now, I believe I have made consumer choices that will lead to less waste: I will probably enjoy the material goods I bought for far longer and I will enjoy using them far more than if I had settled for the cheaper options. In the future, I will try to buy second-hand products when I can help it. And sell my unused goods at a good price to whoever wants to enjoy them.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is not really the philosophy suggested by the movement; from what I read, it&#39;s a response to today&#39;s incredibly fast-paced society that we&#39;ve created for ourselves. You may or may not feel the same way, but lately I have indeed been willing to slow down a little, to let the dust settle <em>(one of my favorite idioms, haha)</em>, and, as they put it on their website, to ‚Äústop the world [because] I want to get off‚Äù. If you&#39;re tempted to shout ‚ÄúFirst World Problems!!‚Äù at me for writing something like that, well, you would be right. I live comfortably from a home in a First World country, and I find time to write about how the world is going too fast for me, what a pity!</p>\n<p>The truth is that I was born in this machine, and now I realize ‚Äî far too late ‚Äî that it will not go on, that it is not sustainable, that it will instead lead to more pain and suffering. With that, I want to go on living a good life, and spend time thinking about interesting ways out of this global predicament.</p>\n<p><code>2:34pm:</code> While reading the <a href=\"https://www.slowmovement.com/\">Wikipedia article for the Slow Movement</a>, I ended rabbit-holeing my way to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography\">Psychogeography</a> page, a concept I first learned while I was studying in Bordeaux and attended a conference in which a speaker described it in enough detail to keep me interested! Basically, it&#39;s somewhat related to the Slow Movement, in that it promotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive\">&quot;drifting&quot;</a> through the streets (and landmarks) of a city, without a destination, simply to observe life, the architecture, the sounds, the smells, etc.</p>\n<p>I love it. I like to take walks through the neighborhood and discover new places by chance, just by letting my mind wander, and letting my body follow it.</p>\n<p><code>8:08pm:</code> I&#39;ve been looking at all this <strong>code</strong> today, and I think I&#39;m going to try something with this blog, to make it a little more future-proof.

Somehow, I am grateful to have been given this time of incredibly deep reflection, in this time of deep turmoil. I don&#39;t pretend to know the answers, but I like to write out my feelings on this blog, maybe as a way to keep a trace of my (and our?) state of mind.</p>\n<p>First of all, if you&#39;re reading this: you&#39;re awesome!</p>\n<p>What I mean is that we&#39;re all in this together, and there&#39;s no <em>deus ex machina</em> waiting to jump in to save us from this bitter drama. We&#39;re human beings, we have neighbors, friends, family. We have jobs, some of us have good jobs which we enjoy and pay good money. We need to keep together, and share that wealth.  Nothing fucks me up more than seeing people adopt a mentality of individualism, of greed... those people won&#39;t go far. And they need to be shown the light.</p>\n<p>Last year it took all I had to keep it together psychologically. I can&#39;t even begin to think about going through this ordeal with as fragile a spirit as I had in October 2019. What changed? A perspective change? Becoming a father? Landing a good job, and working with good people? It probably helped.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m still optimistic because I want to believe that, deep down, most of us will follow science, and will try to do the best we can. We need to be calm, get off social media, and nourish our brains with healthy bits and habits. These days our minds are under attack, as some entities (corporations? politicians? governments? lobby groups? I don&#39;t give a fuck who) weaponize the Internet for their own gains; I love the web, but we need to claim it back for ourselves. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and many other companies hell-bent on making profits off the backs of the common people... we don&#39;t need them. We fucking don&#39;t. At this point, the wonderful, magical capabilities of the tools they offer do not outweigh what I would call the &quot;hidden costs&quot; of using them.</p>\n<p>And this is coming from someone whose livelihood depends on these companies! But frankly, this isn&#39;t what I signed up for... but I&#39;m one guy. How do we fight back? How do we turn the tide? Am I a tired old bourgeois hipster who doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about? YES! AND I&#39;M NOT ALONE, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON! <em>NOBODY!</em></p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":1,"commentId":"2020-10-01_1"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":2,"commentId":"2020-10-01_2"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":3,"commentId":"2020-10-01_3"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":4,"commentId":"2020-10-01_4"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":5,"commentId":"2020-10-01_5"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":6,"commentId":"2020-10-01_6"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":7,"commentId":"2020-10-01_7"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":8,"commentId":"2020-10-01_8"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":9,"commentId":"2020-10-01_9"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":10,"commentId":"2020-10-01_10"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":11,"commentId":"2020-10-01_11"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":12,"commentId":"2020-10-01_12"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":13,"commentId":"2020-10-01_13"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":14,"commentId":"2020-10-01_14"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":15,"commentId":"2020-10-01_15"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":16,"commentId":"2020-10-01_16"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":17,"commentId":"2020-10-01_17"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":18,"commentId":"2020-10-01_18"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":19,"commentId":"2020-10-01_19"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":20,"commentId":"2020-10-01_20"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":21,"commentId":"2020-10-01_21"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":22,"commentId":"2020-10-01_22"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":23,"commentId":"2020-10-01_23"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":24,"commentId":"2020-10-01_24"},{"entryId":"2020-10-01","index":25,"commentId":"2020-10-01_25"}]}],"September 2020":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/09/02/will-i-ever.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"title":"Will I ever...","description":"...reboot that blog?","tags":"update","type":"post","url":"/blog/2020/09/02/will-i-ever","date":"2020-09-02","id":"will-i-ever","year":"2020","month":"09","day":"02","prettyDate":"September 02, 2020","archive":"September 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Refocus","url":"/blog/2020/08/28/refocus","description":"I decided to try and concentrate on other things"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Siphon","url":"/blog/2020/10/01/siphon","description":"Still at it, sometimes..."}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>1:29pm:</code> I&#39;m still at it, trying to figure out what to do with this blog. The truth is: the blog is fine.</p>\n<p>What I miss is: experimentation, and research. I should have tiny &quot;micro-projects&quot; with which to experiment on new technologies, to apply their principles on a basic app or whatever, but which would <em>also</em> include something I wanted to try... in terms of UX, in terms of design, in terms of UI.</p>\n<p>From the <em>funky little projects</em> pile, I could pick the one about particle physics, where I would explain the basics of particles with 3D models in the browsers, and animations, etc. Obviously, it sounds like nothing to me when I casually give it a thought or two, but in practice I expect this project to require at least two full months of hard work (because they will be spread out to the moments in the day when I&#39;m not on daddy duty)</p>\n<p>Question is: do I believe the time investment to be wise? Depending on the scope of the project and how it&#39;s going in the first few iterations, maybe!</p>\n<p><code>1:52pm:</code> The only missing feature for this blog, is a way to edit stuff online, or at least to have a way to quickly add content. I might just refactor this current iteration to: a) use a better templating engine, b) add a <em>markdown edit</em> page, c) allow for <em>server-side compilation</em></p>\n<p>It can be done, and guess what, it can be done without React!</p>\n<p><code>2:23pm:</code> Those who know me, know that I have had a love affair with <a href=\"https://notion.so\">Notion</a>: it&#39;s because it&#39;s really great at giving all the necessary tools to build pages that feel <em>alive</em>!</p>\n<p>At some point, I even told my girlfriend that Notion could be like a replacement for &quot;the web&quot;, because it could empower <em>regular folks</em> to build personal pages like in the old days. Unlike the old days however, Notion provides a clean UI on most platforms, and all the tools one needs to create a masterpiece.</p>\n<p>They struck a nice balance between being a powerful tool and an overly &quot;complex&quot; one. The UI is honestly very simple, although I&#39;ll concede that some people still feel somewhat lost at first, especially if they have never used a similar tool before.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I don&#39;t work for them, I&#39;m not sponsored, etc. you&#39;ll probably hear other stories about it in the future if they play their cards right. Seems like they can boost their valuation to hits the stratosphere soon enough. This shit would be the anti-TikTok, haha! For sure kids aren&#39;t gonna use Notion, though. At heart, it&#39;s still a very business-like application.</p>\n<p>The point is: I want my toolset to help me unleash boundless creativity, and I believe the way to achieve that is to have an <em>environment</em> that provides <strong>many</strong> tools that can be used in the same context, using the same principles. Sort of like <em>addons</em>, <em>extensions</em>, <em>plugins</em>, etc. Every piece of the environment would allow for composing, lego-like, your own personal cathedral. If you read a lot on web development, software engineering and the likes, you&#39;ll have read something that mentions LEGOs at some point, I&#39;m sure! That&#39;s the goal.</p>\n<p>Give me a great Notion API, and I&#39;ll use it for my backend in a heartbeat!</p>\n<p>Then again, I like to build my own tools, so we&#39;ll see!</p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":1,"commentId":"2020-09-02_1"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":2,"commentId":"2020-09-02_2"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":3,"commentId":"2020-09-02_3"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":4,"commentId":"2020-09-02_4"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":5,"commentId":"2020-09-02_5"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":6,"commentId":"2020-09-02_6"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":7,"commentId":"2020-09-02_7"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":8,"commentId":"2020-09-02_8"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":9,"commentId":"2020-09-02_9"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":10,"commentId":"2020-09-02_10"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":11,"commentId":"2020-09-02_11"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":12,"commentId":"2020-09-02_12"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":13,"commentId":"2020-09-02_13"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":14,"commentId":"2020-09-02_14"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":15,"commentId":"2020-09-02_15"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":16,"commentId":"2020-09-02_16"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":17,"commentId":"2020-09-02_17"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":18,"commentId":"2020-09-02_18"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":19,"commentId":"2020-09-02_19"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":20,"commentId":"2020-09-02_20"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":21,"commentId":"2020-09-02_21"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":22,"commentId":"2020-09-02_22"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":23,"commentId":"2020-09-02_23"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":24,"commentId":"2020-09-02_24"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":25,"commentId":"2020-09-02_25"}]}],"August 2020":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/08/28/refocus.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"title":"Refocus","description":"I decided to try and concentrate on other things","tags":"update","type":"post","url":"/blog/2020/08/28/refocus","date":"2020-08-28","id":"refocus","year":"2020","month":"08","day":"28","prettyDate":"August 28, 2020","archive":"August 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Webpacked to Heck","url":"/blog/2020/08/27/webpacked-to-heck","description":"modern web development tooling"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Will I ever...","url":"/blog/2020/09/02/will-i-ever","description":"...reboot that blog?"}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>3:55pm:</code> Ok so, in light of the previous entries it&#39;s fair to say I&#39;ve been getting increasingly frustrated by this blog-overhaul process and so I&#39;ve decided to start really slow and small: I&#39;ll setup a <em>beta</em> version of the blog for live-testing purposes, and I will build it to be as simple and straightforward as I can.</p>\n<p>Nothing fancy, but I will add to it, bit by bit, little by little.

The mission is to regain control of my medium of choice, to go back to the basics and take back full possession of my virtual environment: the <em>networked computer</em>. We <strong>all</strong> use connected devices, be it a cellphone or a laptop, and yet few people can truly claim that they know how their devices&#39; software works! It&#39;s cool... I get it, I know it&#39;s complicated, and it&#39;s the highly technical job of developers and engineers to figure out how to build it and sell it to consumers, so why worry?</p>\n<p>But hold on there... my mission is broader. It&#39;s not only computer and software. It&#39;s about claiming back control, regain full understanding and knowledge, of most of the technology (in a broad sense) we use in our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>Do you know how electricity works? I don&#39;t really know; and yet it&#39;s behind everything I use, everything that gave me a job and a livelihood.</p>\n<p>Do you know how plants grow? How fabric is made? How engines work? etc.</p>\n<p>Modern society gave us all this stuff, these magical substances and these mighty machines, invented and crafted by experts and those who don&#39;t understand them can still use them! It&#39;s fine. However, as a developer, I believe I <em>should</em> understand every aspect underlying my work. And it&#39;s deep. It&#39;s deep, and somewhat hidden... literally, in <em>code</em>. It&#39;s deep, because it now powers platforms that actually shift political power, it&#39;s a economic behemoth waking up from a slumber, ready to strike: and what I want, is to be part of the people who get to choose what this giant is going to do, or at least steer the beast toward a benevolent path.</p>\n<p>I feel it is our responsibility to gain control of this virtual space before governments or corporations (worse!) wrap their dirty hands around it and choke it. There is much work to be done, and this is why it&#39;s fascinating and exciting and inspiring.</p>\n<p><code>9:47am:</code> Research avenues to make a change in this space (that&#39;s according to my own ideas, which I&#39;m forming as I type this text, haha):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>teaching the basics, clearly and pragmatically, of computers, programming, etc.</li>\n<li>coming up with more &quot;Free and Open-Source Software&quot; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software\">FOSS</a>) maintained by people who share the same vision (ties in with teaching programming: you get to train people to maintain the next generations of FOSS)</li>\n<li>more broadly: educating people on the promises, limitations, and dangers of modern communication channels (by that I mean: TikTok, Instagram, Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. and their business model, what is at stake, what it adds to your life and how it can be replaced, etc. etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Basically: I&#39;m against those giant corporations unfurling their tentacles to capture every strategic outpost.

Yesterday I thought about robustness and how to build with it in mind; it occured to me that redundancy was one way of building something into a system to make it less prone to catastrophic failures.</p>\n<p>I care deeply about what kind of experience a user is having when interacting with an interface. I think &quot;code execution failures&quot; (i.e. <em>bugs</em>) are obviously very detrimental to the experience of a user. Finding and fixing bugs is a task we find ourselves working on arduously almost every day.</p>\n<p>So far in my career, I&#39;ve never worked on a project where I had to write &quot;tests&quot;, which is one way developers have found to make their codebase much more robust (i.e. by letting some code or program &quot;catch&quot; your mistakes before users discover them on their own!)</p>\n<p>I think tests are cool; but it&#39;s still code, and they&#39;re only written to test specific bits of logic. I&#39;ve been thinking about writing something like tests, but <em>inside</em> the codebase: the code would attempt to do something, then try to figure out if everything went smoothly.</p>\n<p>To a user, one of the most important things is for the interface to respond appropriately to a given input. And a test will make sure that, given a specific input, the program returns the expected output.\nBut user input is much less specific: it&#39;s erratic, somehow unpredictable, and the output that the user expects... might not even be what the test was told to expect.</p>\n<p>There are many <em>bugs</em> you won&#39;t catch with tests. I feel that constant <em>use</em> (i.e. using the program to achieve something) is what ultimately make the most pressing issues apparent. And I want to think about how to make it less frustrating for users to deal with bugs, as they try to use the program.\nPossible research avenues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>allow multiple ways of achievings things (lets the user try something else to achieve the desired results)</li>\n<li>allow feedback straight from the interface, to inform the developers that something isn&#39;t right (lets the developer fix real-life issues)<ul>\n<li>that can be done using <em>analytics</em> (or <em>tracking</em>!) but from my experience, all that Google Analytics nonsense is mainly used as a way to show that your program/interface is getting you more money! Am I wrong? I&#39;ve never been told by any SEO/SEM expert to try and fix my code because of a discrepancy in the tracking data, which I think can and should be done regularly? Maybe it falls within the purview of a web developer? ughhhhh....</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>write the code in such a way that it loops back on itself, and analyses its own output according to some expectations, and eventually corrects obvious mistakes<ul>\n<li>or at least informs the user (via a popup or something?) that something might have gone wrong?</li>\n<li>or informs the developer that this output might have caused an error (this probably means keeping a record of the user&#39;s inputs for troubleshooting purposes, which might constitute a breach of privacy)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>8:43am:</code> Whoa, I wrote a lot of stuff!

But, as I mentioned earlier: the package needs to be <strong>small</strong>.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m no stranger to overkill because the very simple website hosted on fredmercy.ca is still powered by a React app.</p>\n<p><code>2:12pm:</code> Then again if the goal is to produce the smallest filesize possible, maybe I should consider Svelte and get real nerdy with that one? It&#39;s new, it&#39;s weird, it&#39;s minimal; maybe it&#39;s what I need?</p>\n<p><code>2:14pm:</code> I&#39;m thinking of not sleeping anymore to try and work on my side-projects at night so that I won&#39;t be bothered by the normal events of daily life. Apparently, it&#39;s lethal to be sleep-deprived for too long: win-win!</p>\n<p><code>2:20pm:</code> So tired and hot and angry that I don&#39;t want to go on working on this blog today. This project is inches away from being thrown into the garbage bin. I just don&#39;t have the fucking energy nor the time.</p>\n<p>More updates later I guess...</p>\n<p>EDIT: this entry was crazy... I was crazy back then, eh! haha.\nFor real though, I&#39;m torn between using the &quot;standard&quot; technology stack and just rolling my own little crazy personal stack with some weird Javascript. I have ideas and I need time to test them out; I&#39;m really excited.</p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":1,"commentId":"2020-08-07_1"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":2,"commentId":"2020-08-07_2"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":3,"commentId":"2020-08-07_3"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":4,"commentId":"2020-08-07_4"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":5,"commentId":"2020-08-07_5"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":6,"commentId":"2020-08-07_6"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":7,"commentId":"2020-08-07_7"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":8,"commentId":"2020-08-07_8"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":9,"commentId":"2020-08-07_9"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":10,"commentId":"2020-08-07_10"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":11,"commentId":"2020-08-07_11"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":12,"commentId":"2020-08-07_12"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":13,"commentId":"2020-08-07_13"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":14,"commentId":"2020-08-07_14"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":15,"commentId":"2020-08-07_15"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":16,"commentId":"2020-08-07_16"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":17,"commentId":"2020-08-07_17"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":18,"commentId":"2020-08-07_18"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":19,"commentId":"2020-08-07_19"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":20,"commentId":"2020-08-07_20"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":21,"commentId":"2020-08-07_21"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":22,"commentId":"2020-08-07_22"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":23,"commentId":"2020-08-07_23"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":24,"commentId":"2020-08-07_24"},{"entryId":"2020-08-07","index":25,"commentId":"2020-08-07_25"}]}],"July 2020":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/07/31/end-of-july.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"title":"End of July","description":"long long long, but no time!?","tags":"update","type":"post","url":"/blog/2020/07/31/end-of-july","date":"2020-07-31","id":"end-of-july","year":"2020","month":"07","day":"31","prettyDate":"July 31, 2020","archive":"July 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Long Hot Summer of 2020","url":"/blog/2020/06/21/long-hot-summer-of-2020","description":"...and I'm in the camp of the ultra-privileged hippies"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"jammed","url":"/blog/2020/08/07/jammed","description":"breathe in, breathe out, edibles in, time out"}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>11:15pm:</code> Took a little time tonight to revive the old blog.</p>\n<p>Thinking about what technology to use to make version 2 of the blog has kept me\nup at night.

First of all, it&#39;s clear we&#39;re all getting the same treatment, give or take. No matter who you are, today you just can&#39;t escape the state of the <strong>world</strong>. Second of all, we&#39;re not about to give up the hope of a better <strong>world</strong>, are we?!</p>\n<p>We&#39;ve just <em>got</em> to switch things up, and kick all the best things into high gear, because now&#39;s the time.</p>\n<p>We have plenty of time to think about all of this. What are we gonna do? I don&#39;t have the answers to that great question. But instead, I think about random stuff. Here are some thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This crisis really makes it self-evident that the Internet is what will allow all of us to communicate, share, purchase, entertain ourselves, etc.\nAs a web developer, I feel grateful to find myself in an <strong>industry</strong> that should remain strong despite this time off, and not only that, but to also find myself able to maybe make a difference in people&#39;s lives by building a better web.</li>\n<li>I think Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality will finally prove to be extremely useful. They will be used in many areas, for professional and entertainment purposes, for productivity purposes, for teaching purposes, and so on to infinity!</li>\n<li>Connected cities are needed. Sustainable cities are needed. Democratic and &quot;just&quot; cities are needed. We want to live in a highly functioning community without all the dystopian crap.\nFuck corporations, fuck shareholders, fuck profiteers, fuck those greedy bastards trying to amass the most wealth: who got you the amazing things that keep you alive in times like these? Your business acumen? To some extent, sure, I&#39;ll give you that, but ultimately the <strong>real deal</strong> is: SCIENCE.</li>\n<li>In my conversations, my solution to fix everything that&#39;s wrong in the world always ended up being a mix of two fundamental things: education and health. Keep your society filled with <em>healthy educated people</em>, and I believe you&#39;ll see great things happen in no time.</li>\n<li>Of course, science isn&#39;t the only thing you need. We also need a lot more COMPASSION. Less individualism. Work hard on yourself, for yourself, but also for the fabled <em>greater good</em>. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8\">Give it Away</a> by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;m rambling!</p>\n<p>Also, don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed but I feel a LOT better these days. I&#39;ll write all about it soon! For now though, I hope you have a good day! üôè</p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":1,"commentId":"2020-04-02_1"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":2,"commentId":"2020-04-02_2"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":3,"commentId":"2020-04-02_3"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":4,"commentId":"2020-04-02_4"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":5,"commentId":"2020-04-02_5"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":6,"commentId":"2020-04-02_6"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":7,"commentId":"2020-04-02_7"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":8,"commentId":"2020-04-02_8"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":9,"commentId":"2020-04-02_9"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":10,"commentId":"2020-04-02_10"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":11,"commentId":"2020-04-02_11"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":12,"commentId":"2020-04-02_12"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":13,"commentId":"2020-04-02_13"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":14,"commentId":"2020-04-02_14"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":15,"commentId":"2020-04-02_15"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":16,"commentId":"2020-04-02_16"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":17,"commentId":"2020-04-02_17"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":18,"commentId":"2020-04-02_18"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":19,"commentId":"2020-04-02_19"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":20,"commentId":"2020-04-02_20"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":21,"commentId":"2020-04-02_21"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":22,"commentId":"2020-04-02_22"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":23,"commentId":"2020-04-02_23"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":24,"commentId":"2020-04-02_24"},{"entryId":"2020-04-02","index":25,"commentId":"2020-04-02_25"}]}],"March 2020":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/03/15/untitled.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"description":"Strange times, good times, harsh times","tags":"journal","type":"post","url":"/blog/2020/03/15/untitled","date":"2020-03-15","id":"untitled","year":"2020","month":"03","day":"15","prettyDate":"March 15, 2020","archive":"March 2020","previous":{"meta":{"url":"/blog/2020/03/14/untitled","description":"Isolation"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Alright...","url":"/blog/2020/04/02/alright","description":"This is time to change shit up."}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>8:54am:</code> Another breakfast update today: I think I&#39;ll be working on a solo project over the next few days.

A break, a fissure in time, a cataclysm, or something inescapable somehow forces the flow of timespace to take an unexpected new path, but now with more pressure, more velocity, to carve out something much deeper.</p>\n<p>Well, I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m a bit lost. But being lost also allows you to go anywhere else, right? If you&#39;re completely lost, what good does it do to stay put? You gotta move, in any direction, or the direction that you instinctively decide is the right one, at least for now. Being lost and finding one&#39;s way has got to be an exercize in trial and error. Walk a few miles, look around, map out the area; what do you see? Is it promising? Is there something you think you might need, something you might want over there? Well go on, then!</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ve been walking towards learning music theory. I&#39;m not running towards it, you know... I&#39;m steadily walking towards it at a very leisurely pace.

I wish I could see something shiny in the distance, a glowing light, warm and inviting... then I would gather all my energy and runs towards that instead.</p>\n<p>But I can&#39;t see anything. It&#39;s foggy as fuck.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m setting goals for myself. I&#39;m setting myself for failure, but failures are merely the steps that lead to success, right? That&#39;s the frame of mind I should adopt anyway. Setting a few goals, trying to forget whatever I think <em>prevents</em> me from reaching them, trying to <strong>focus</strong> instead. Focus, motivation, determination, perseverance, a can-do attitude, optimism, stubbornness... what to do to exhibit those qualities? I mean... I&#39;m already stubborn, but <em>optimistic</em>? Fuck no. And determined? Focused?

It&#39;s simply a long string of false starts, and periods of deep anxiety, that stifled the small amount of inspiration I had struggled to muster up those past few weeks.</p>\n<p>To promise anything in the next few weeks would be foolish, but the least I can do is try my darndest to get into a better headspace and finally start working on something.</p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":1,"commentId":"2019-05-08_1"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":2,"commentId":"2019-05-08_2"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":3,"commentId":"2019-05-08_3"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":4,"commentId":"2019-05-08_4"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":5,"commentId":"2019-05-08_5"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":6,"commentId":"2019-05-08_6"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":7,"commentId":"2019-05-08_7"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":8,"commentId":"2019-05-08_8"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":9,"commentId":"2019-05-08_9"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":10,"commentId":"2019-05-08_10"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":11,"commentId":"2019-05-08_11"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":12,"commentId":"2019-05-08_12"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":13,"commentId":"2019-05-08_13"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":14,"commentId":"2019-05-08_14"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":15,"commentId":"2019-05-08_15"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":16,"commentId":"2019-05-08_16"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":17,"commentId":"2019-05-08_17"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":18,"commentId":"2019-05-08_18"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":19,"commentId":"2019-05-08_19"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":20,"commentId":"2019-05-08_20"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":21,"commentId":"2019-05-08_21"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":22,"commentId":"2019-05-08_22"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":23,"commentId":"2019-05-08_23"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":24,"commentId":"2019-05-08_24"},{"entryId":"2019-05-08","index":25,"commentId":"2019-05-08_25"}]}],"April 2019":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2019/04/30/whooosh.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"title":"Whooosh","description":"Life gives you lemons, and orange, and apples, and bananas and you gotta choose wisely, or else...!","tags":"journal","type":"post","url":"/blog/2019/04/30/whooosh","date":"2019-04-30","id":"whooosh","year":"2019","month":"04","day":"30","prettyDate":"April 30, 2019","archive":"April 2019","previous":{"meta":{"url":"/blog/2019/04/27/untitled","description":"Updates are few and far between; tells me that I need to pick up the pace"}},"next":{"meta":{"url":"/blog/2019/05/08/untitled","description":"Pressed reset; waiting for the opening credits to roll through."}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>4:08pm:</code> Working hard, not seeing time fly by and it&#39;s already the end of the month.

It sounds great, it&#39;s open-source and I like the name, that&#39;s dope, but I have personal opinions and/or arguments against even the <em>idea</em> of a social platform:</p>\n<p>Facebook used to make me a bit depressed. Why? Because I felt like nothing was happening in my life, and my friends had way more opportunities and energy to attend events, travel, hang out with cool people. Was it all an illusion; and those friends were simply embellishing their mundane daily lives? Possible.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, I don&#39;t care. My problem with it was the amount of information I would receive from (and about) the people I followed, the time and brain power it consumed, just to make me feel like shit. In no way did I feel closer to my friends (on the contrary), or more informed (maybe, on the contrary), or more entertained (on the contrary, it bummed me out and made me angry), or anything.</p>\n<p>So I quit.

But nowadays our cellphones do so many things they ended up replacing our cameras, calendars, newspapers, voice recorders, maps (and GPS), televisions, calculators, etc.</p>\n<code class=\"collapse\">\n<button type=\"button\">Show/Hide pseudo-philosophical rant</button>\n\n<p>What I think we gain in convenience, practicality, and productivity, we lose in physicality, purposefulness, and mindfulness. At the risk of sounding like an old degenerate, I think having a specific device for each use-case makes the user much more involved with the process. I see this virtualization of our physical devices as a first step towards full acceptance of the coming ‚Äúvirtual reality‚Äù revolution: get people used to <em>apps</em>, so that when they&#39;re pulled into an ever more virtual world, the idea of replacing physical objects with their digital counterparts will seem very normal, and commonplace. Why own art, candles, a TV, a guitar?... hell, why even have windows and lightbulbs?! Put on your goggles and slip into a bright new world!</p>\n<p>The ultimate down-sizing: objects are broken down to bits, and their digital ersatz are fed back to us!</p>\n<p><em>Ahem.</em> Sorry about that. It&#39;s probably better to refer to authors who have thought longer and harder about all this... I guess what I&#39;m saying is: I&#39;m scared of the future, because of how boring it might be. But as someone keeps telling me: there&#39;s no use in being pessimistic.

So I guess I&#39;m rich.</p>\n<p>But anyway, these days I try to streamline my life, and get rid of things that are... while definitely interesting and entertaining from the first instant, are also sucking my precious time into their vortex. I&#39;m of course talking about social media again, about YouTube and reddit and others. Big surprise!</p>\n<p>How do I go about doing that? First of all, I think about what I want to do with my time, with my life. It&#39;s super tough for me because I don&#39;t know 100% yet, I&#39;m a bit aimless, and this is why it&#39;s so easy for those ‚Äúinfinite content‚Äù websites to hog all of my free time. Back when I was a teen, I thought it was super <em>cool</em> of me not to watch TV anymore, and actually seek content online, things I truly want to know about. And nowadays I&#39;m using the web like I&#39;d be watching TV: letting myself drift on a handful of channels, gobbling up the content, jumping from one to the other every minute...</p>\n<p>For sure the internet is great when you have an interest, a passion, or something to build and you seek out a community, and wikis or other knowledge repositories. These days I&#39;m not too focused on anything particular so I&#39;m trying to shake all that complacency off of me, and concentrate on what&#39;s important to me.</p>\n<p>Meditation sure helps; there seems to be some sort of trend that started around mindfulness, and I think it&#39;s great. But it&#39;s even easier than that, really: just sit there, do nothing, and look a bit aimlessly at your surroundings, and you let yourself think about your problems, and then let the flow of your thoughts take you wherever. To me, simply doing this feels good, it feels like it&#39;s reparative, and constructive.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the problem, I think: YouTube, Instagram, reddit, and really, any &quot;feed-like&quot; website providing heaps of content will just keep you so busy, so entertained, so satisfied with so much new shiny tidbits, that you&#39;ll forget how to be bored, and how it&#39;s actually a <em>great</em> thing to be bored.</p>\n<p>Being bored is amazing. It&#39;s starting from zero, and it forces you to consider what it is you truly want to do next.</p>\n<p>I remember being a kid and going to visit my grandmother in the countryside, and there was no internet, no computer, no videogames. I would feel a bit bored for a minute, but then I&#39;d find something to do: draw, read magazines, do collages, and other less creative things of course, but usually it&#39;s the creative things that were the most gratifying.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a bit difficult to force yourself into this <em>low-stimulus</em> state, and willingly manufacture a situation where there&#39;s a dearth of entertaining activities. Even now I choose to type this inane blog entry instead of producing real work, just because it&#39;s more fun and it passes the time.</p>\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":1,"commentId":"2019-02-20_1"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":2,"commentId":"2019-02-20_2"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":3,"commentId":"2019-02-20_3"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":4,"commentId":"2019-02-20_4"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":5,"commentId":"2019-02-20_5"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":6,"commentId":"2019-02-20_6"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":7,"commentId":"2019-02-20_7"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":8,"commentId":"2019-02-20_8"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":9,"commentId":"2019-02-20_9"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":10,"commentId":"2019-02-20_10"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":11,"commentId":"2019-02-20_11"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":12,"commentId":"2019-02-20_12"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":13,"commentId":"2019-02-20_13"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":14,"commentId":"2019-02-20_14"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":15,"commentId":"2019-02-20_15"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":16,"commentId":"2019-02-20_16"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":17,"commentId":"2019-02-20_17"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":18,"commentId":"2019-02-20_18"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":19,"commentId":"2019-02-20_19"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":20,"commentId":"2019-02-20_20"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":21,"commentId":"2019-02-20_21"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":22,"commentId":"2019-02-20_22"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":23,"commentId":"2019-02-20_23"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":24,"commentId":"2019-02-20_24"},{"entryId":"2019-02-20","index":25,"commentId":"2019-02-20_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2019/02/19/calm-before-the-storm.md","_html":"templates/post","meta":{"title":"The Calm Before The Storm","description":"Chill down before you spaz out","tags":"journal, long","type":"post","url":"/blog/2019/02/19/calm-before-the-storm","date":"2019-02-19","id":"calm-before-the-storm","year":"2019","month":"02","day":"19","prettyDate":"February 19, 2019","archive":"February 2019","previous":{"meta":{"title":"On Tour","url":"/blog/2019/02/16/on-tour","description":"Vacationing, traveling, moving, and all those things"}},"next":{"meta":{"url":"/blog/2019/02/20/untitled","description":"What Is This All About?"}},"parents":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}],"breadcrumbs":[{"_filePath":"./content/blog.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"Blog","description":"Random Thoughts or whatever","type":"page","template":"templates/blog","id":"blog","url":"/blog","route":["blog"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[],"breadcrumbs":[]},"content":""}]},"content":"<p><code>9:20am:</code> Trying to motivate oneself while sitting in a caf√© somewhere sunny, somewhere remote, isn&#39;t easy.

(note: it did got pretty big)</p>\n<p>Art and music are central to my life, even though you wouldn&#39;t immediately see it. Emotions conveyed through music is the single most important thing to my existence. Other forms of art are cool too, but they don&#39;t move me like music does. And it&#39;s a shame I didn&#39;t pursue it further.\nMaybe it was a way to protect that hobby.</p>\n<p><code>9:40am:</code> I&#39;m reluctant to post images on this blog (it&#39;s supposed to be a minimalist website, almost 100% text-based) but here are two pictures from my current location: <a href=\"/files/pictures/travel_2019_02_19.jpg\">Picture of street</a> | <a href=\"/files/pictures/travel_mtn_2019_02_18.jpg\">Picture of mountain</a></p>\n<p><em>Developer rant ahead:</em> my blog is a reaction to how bloated web pages have become. I really wanted it to be light, and use as little funky little widgets as possible. I have a little bit of javascript happening, and I&#39;ll expand it as days go by and I need to impress my audience (<em>haha!</em>) but if it becomes too large, I&#39;ll figure out a way to chop it up into bits and only use the bits I need. I was tempted to come up with an image viewer for the pictures above, and it would be, like, <strong>fun</strong> to develop it, but also a bit superfluous: just click on the image, it opens in your browser, you can see it, zoom on it, whatever, save it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">Keep It Small &amp; Simple</a></p>\n<p><code>5:17pm:</code> Sent some emails, managed my life, has a nano-crisis with the SO.

Nowadays, even in new environment, if nothing truly fascinating is happening, I just won&#39;t immortalize anything. What those eyes of mine have seen...

I feel like we&#39;re already very deep in that nowadays, like it&#39;s crazy. What&#39;s crazy is that I get to work in an industry that&#39;s all about building stuff <strong>inside this reality</strong>... That there&#39;s an industry that pays well, where you&#39;re paid to build virtual pages that are viewed by millions of other <em>connected</em> people.</p>\n<p>I was born before the explosion of the Internet, but computers already fascinated me, so I&#39;ve always known about it. It was too far, inaccessible; too adult, and too geeky even for me. But by age 12, I was a regular user of the Web and I was happy as hell.</p>\n<p>On there, <em>in</em> there, I had found a world full of answers. And most of it was free: it was just a web of people sharing stuff. They got alhold of this new way of broadcasting a message to the World: it&#39;s not radio, it&#39;s not telephone... it&#39;s some digital craziness is what it is! They jacked into the <em>World Wide Web</em> and shared content. Man, that&#39;s what the Internet was about.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#39;m old. The Internet obviously grew grew and... became something else. It grew up, and now it&#39;s ultra powerful. It&#39;s everywhere. It has obviously replaced many things, to some extent: to use my own example as an anecdote, I don&#39;t watch TV anymore, I don&#39;t listen to the radio, I don&#39;t have a newspaper subscription (although I receive <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/\">Nature</a> every week! yay), I don&#39;t write on shit (nothing that <em>matters</em> at least), I don&#39;t go to the movies, etc.\nYo, it&#39;s friggin&#39; everywhere for me! With this power must come great responsibilities as it goes but the Internet as a technology isn&#39;t truly separate from us: we still have the power to reign it in. We should never let it lull us into a state of complacency nor should we any other technology. Humans should wake up to the reality that their technological reach is tickling weird part of the Planet and stranger part of the human psyche.</p>\n<p>On this blog, you&#39;ll read a lot about how advertising is really <em>fucked up</em>. You probably already know that instinctively: fuck ads before my YouTube videos, between my Instagram stories, etc. Ads suck. The advertising industry is a merchant of bullshit. It&#39;s coersion, it&#39;s manipulation, it&#39;s hypnosis, it&#39;s misdirection. I work in this industry and I&#39;ll make a post about that; but for now, I just want to say that the real problem... guys... is simply wealth distribution. Why is it pulling all that talent? Why is it a money gravity well? Because it fucking works. It&#39;s disgusting.</p>\n<p>I call myself a hippie, but I&#39;m a big fraud. I worked for the ad industry for a long long time, and it has paid for my lifestyle. Being able to build website is a great skill to have, for sure; but why use that to sell more bullshit to people? Because money?! Because a lifestyle is important to have? Yep.</p>\n<p>Having chosen to become a web developer, I felt the Internet shifting from under me over the years. One year witnessing the absolutely staggering rise of Google<sup data-note=\"(which honestly, I was amazed by at the beginning)\">[1]</sup>. Another year the creation and rise of Facebook. The Internet is being taken over by huge silos. We&#39;re now tracked everywhere we go, every site we visit. If you&#39;re logged into Facebook, they get your name, and your friends. They target ads with crazy accuracy, yadda yada! We all know that, right? Right? What can we do about it?</p>\n<p>Can&#39;t put the genie back in the bottle: kids are on youtube, teens are on tiktok, adults are on twitter and facebook. We&#39;re all connected, and <em>manipulated</em>. Yeah but we&#39;re manipulated by ads, it&#39;s cool. Nah dude, it&#39;s not fucking cool, bro! I want to steer clear from anything that tries to manipulate me!</p>\n<p>Shit, listen to me rant about the Internet. When you read the first paragraphs of this word-vomit, I sound super nostalgic of an <em>older, better</em> Internet. This is why I feel really old, man: I&#39;m still fully employed working on those damn websites, but I understand nothing of this beast. It&#39;s cool to talk to people who have personal websites. For sure these people must be few and far between, but they exist. And obviously I&#39;m talking about people who work in the industry, probably; otherwise they would have used a service like those <em>easy-baked</em> website-makers. I would love to be much much more underground and be a guy who makes websites for mom and pop&#39;s stores, their neighbors and their dogs, you know? I wish we could reclaim the Internet as it was a while ago: having a presence online we you could communicate however you wanted. Why rent a space on a third-party ad-riddled service like Facebook&#39;s?</p>\n<p>Obviously, there&#39;s always something great about a website/app that brings EVERYBODY together. But could it instead by public? Couldn&#39;t it be open-sourced? Maybe the next step is a state-sponsored, totally end-to-end encrypted, low-power usage, locally-federated, well maintained, not-for-profit, widely cross-platform... search engine and messaging app?</p>\n"},{"_filePath":"./content/notes/drafts/a-hypocritical-life.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"A Hypocritical Life","description":"Trying to find my Ikigai","type":"page","id":"a-hypocritical-life","url":"/notes/drafts/a-hypocritical-life","route":["notes","drafts","a-hypocritical-life"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[{"meta":{"title":"Notes & Thoughts","url":"/notes","description":"Feel free to browse"}}],"breadcrumbs":[{"meta":{"title":"Notes & Thoughts","url":"/notes","description":"Feel free to browse"}}]},"content":"<p>Hello?</p>\n"},{"_filePath":"./content/notes/drafts/quitting-facebook.md","_html":"templates/page","meta":{"title":"On Quitting Facebook (and others)","description":"A quest to cut ties with monopolistic datamongers","type":"page","id":"quitting-facebook","url":"/notes/drafts/quitting-facebook","route":["notes","drafts","quitting-facebook"],"isHome":false,"children":[],"parents":[{"meta":{"title":"Notes & Thoughts","url":"/notes","description":"Feel free to browse"}}],"breadcrumbs":[{"meta":{"title":"Notes & Thoughts","url":"/notes","description":"Feel free to browse"}}]},"content":"<h2 id=\"how-i-got-on-it\">how i got on it</h2>\n<p>I remember vividly when I first heard of Facebook and opened an account on it. It was 2007, I was still a student in France, I was reading some nerdy book about black holes when a German dude started asking me about it. We had a cool conversation: he was traveling around the world with a friend of his, and I was a bit skeptical of his story so he said ‚Äúadd me on Facebook, you&#39;ll see!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Facebook was new to me, but not to my friends. Although I spent a lot of time on the internet, I had never of it, and yet most of my <em>offline</em> friends were already on it. Weird!</p>\n<p>First thing I hated about it was the fact that, for some reason, people decided it was a good idea to start using their real name to create an account. Okay, why not. Also, the interface was drab and lifeless, especially if you compare it with the insanity of its main competitor at the time, MySpace. It&#39;s not to say I loved MySpace, but it was a lot more personal, and quirky, and all over the place. Facebook was rigid.</p>\n<p>Anyways. It took me ten years of using it, of adding people on it, posting on it, of reading stupid status update from <strong>EVERYBODY</strong>, of feeling wrong about it, before I decided to leave the platform. To explain, let me backtrack to the moment I felt like something was up:</p>\n<p>It seems obvious to us now that Facebook is poison but back in 2012, most people were happily using Facebook and its apps without fear that their addiction to the platform might steer them towards wherever the platform <em>wanted</em> them to go. It reminds me of an argument that two friends had over what <em>the Facebook algorithm</em> was<sup data-note=\"An argument which was never resolved because both understood different things when they hear ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù\">[1]</sup>: one of them said that there was an algorithm that made Facebook what it is. At the time, I was like ‚Äúit&#39;s not so much an algorithm, but rather a way of building their network‚Äù. Nowadays, I would say that there is a <em>Facebook algorithm</em>, which is the way they set everything up so that you are shown the right ads, get the most pertinent recommendations, read the promoted posts (from the highest bidders), etc.</p>\n<p>A shit-ton of people are on Facebook, giving away nuggets of information every time they share stuff. Their interactions build networks that allow the company to serve impossibly well targeted ads... disguised as posts. Mark Zuckerberg, that motherfucker, built a &quot;social&quot; network and used it to sell us bullshit. How are we surprised that it poses a threat to society?</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-felt-manipulated\">how i felt manipulated</h2>\n<p>Remember 2016? It was the U.S. elections again, and I was consuming a lot of media and clicking a bunch of links from Facebook. Dude, that shit almost turned me into a libertarian, I swear! Ask my girlfriend!</p>\n<p>The state of the World depressed me, some dumbass TV celebrity was likely to become president, people were hooked on dumb shit, while there&#39;s pollution, climate change, social unrest, a widening wealth gap, etc. It felt like the Internet kept me hooked on it while it was wringing out my brain. I&#39;m shitting on Facebook but the other social networks weren&#39;t better: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc. all rely on curated <em>feeds</em>, sprinkled with advertisement. They can all suck my ass<sup data-note=\"In 2016, I also watched compilations of funny Vines on YouTube, which was very entertaining indeed, if not incredibly mind-numbing.
