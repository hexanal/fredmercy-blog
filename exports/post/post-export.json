So, a myriad of thoughts run through my skull every day, and every day I try to piece them together, I try to figure out from where these thoughts originate, what causes me to think this or that?!\n\nOver the next few days/weeks, my posts will surely contain more (awfully bad) philosophy, as I wrestle with... what I would call a *crisis of the mind*. It's cool; we're all in this together, I think. Nobody's out there feeling absolutely on top of things, right?\n\n*Disclaimer*: you really **don't** have to read the rest of this entry if you don't want to read about web development related stuff!\n\ntype: post\n---\n\n`9:32am:` Ready for some nerdy description of how I manage this blog? Read on, then!\n\n<code class=\"collapse\">\n<button type=\"button\">Toggle the nerd talk ü§ì</button>\n\nCurrently, I have to write this shit in a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file and place it in a properly named folder (from where I infer the date and final URL), then I have to rebuild the whole website using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) from the command line. It's cool, it works. But it's sort of clunky, and slow: that's my fault for having something that rebuilds the whole website every time and there's a very easy fix for that. I should probably look into it.\n\nI have to run the [main website](https://fredmercy.ca)'s server on my laptop because the blog gets built (the actual html files!) into the *blog* folder.\n\nAfter that, when I'm done writing and the post looks good, I use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to *push* those changes on [Github](https://github.com/). Then I [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh_(Secure_Shell)) into my server, [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) into  the right folder, *pull* the changes, and then run a cool *npm run build* command to let the website be what it is.\n\nIf you've read through that and you're not too tech inclined and you're thinking ‚Äúman, this sure looks like a lot of bullshit to go through in order to post blog updates!‚Äù... you're absolutely right!\n\nHowever, I still like it. I like the *slowness* of it, the intentionality of it. It does the job. In the end I have exactly what is needed, even though it still requires some work (and obviously if you've been reading past entries you'll know that I have this burning desire to make this blog as good as possible, which to me means that it should do the absolute minimum to make the reading experience pleasant)\n\nPfew!\n\n</code>\n\nI had an idea yesterday regarding my blog and the way I will manage its updates. I thought of simply *editing HTML directly on the server*.\n\nCrazy, eh? I know. Of course there would be some javascript-powered interaction going on, as always, but the structure would be entirely handled by old me, writing straight HTML, in one file, on the server. It reminds me of how I built one of my first websites! The crazy thing is, since it was just a handful of HTML files, I still have them backed-up somewhere: something I never thought of doing to my numerous Wordpress-powered websites! Those databases are lost in time, victim of the complexity by which they were put together.\n\nBacking up that bitch would require a single [secure copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol) command.\n\nOf course, this throws a big wrench into my plans of leveraging the AWESOME POWER of NextJS to build a *server-side rendered*, *statically-generated*, *progressively-enhanced*, *cybernetically-doped* website.\n\nBut frankly, I'm not trying to compete with Medium right here. I want to carve my own creative path through this tangled mess of Web 2.0 and rewrite the rules.\n\n`3:26pm:` Man, I want to quit... this is becoming super irritating!\n\nIt's too big for me: I just wanted to write some dumb stuff, and play with CSS colors, and add some funky Javascript interactions. Now it seems I have to build a cathedral just to get that shit out there. No thanks, I'm done. Sorry. I'm probably gonna use Wordpress in the end, haha!\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":1,"commentId":"2020-10-15_1"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":2,"commentId":"2020-10-15_2"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":3,"commentId":"2020-10-15_3"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":4,"commentId":"2020-10-15_4"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":5,"commentId":"2020-10-15_5"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":6,"commentId":"2020-10-15_6"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":7,"commentId":"2020-10-15_7"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":8,"commentId":"2020-10-15_8"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":9,"commentId":"2020-10-15_9"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":10,"commentId":"2020-10-15_10"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":11,"commentId":"2020-10-15_11"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":12,"commentId":"2020-10-15_12"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":13,"commentId":"2020-10-15_13"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":14,"commentId":"2020-10-15_14"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":15,"commentId":"2020-10-15_15"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":16,"commentId":"2020-10-15_16"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":17,"commentId":"2020-10-15_17"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":18,"commentId":"2020-10-15_18"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":19,"commentId":"2020-10-15_19"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":20,"commentId":"2020-10-15_20"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":21,"commentId":"2020-10-15_21"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":22,"commentId":"2020-10-15_22"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":23,"commentId":"2020-10-15_23"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":24,"commentId":"2020-10-15_24"},{"entryId":"2020-10-15","index":25,"commentId":"2020-10-15_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/10/13/adventures-in-blogging.md","meta":{"title":"Adventures in Blogging","description":"One day I will have a blog I can be proud of!","tags":"update","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2020-10-13/adventures-in-blogging","url":"/blog/2020-10-13/adventures-in-blogging","date":"2020-10-13","id":"adventures-in-blogging","year":"2020","month":"10","day":"13","prettyDate":"October 13, 2020","archive":"October 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Continue on","url":"/blog/2020-10-07/continue-on","description":"Been working on the blog for a few consecutive hours!"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Fulfillment, Creativity","url":"/blog/2020-10-15/fulfillment-creativity","description":"Aliveness, aliveness"}}},"content":"`11:34am:` My posting schedule is wacky, and I write about really random shit, but my wish for the future is to finally re-build the blog from the ground up, and have the \"content editing\" part of the whole thing be *bulletproof*, so that I can focus on writing things, experimenting on funky dev ideas, animations, maybe play music again and post songs on there, who knows?!\n\nAnyway, I had started working on a very custom solution, which... could have worked... and it kinda does work well enough, considering I only spent a couple of days tinkering with the concepts. It was quite illuminating to force myself to do this because I new know what all the necessary parts are.\n\nI've started the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) tutorial pages, and I will see if it solves my problems. The code already looks similar to my solution, so it's encouraging. A few years ago when I first tested it, it didn't quite fit. There were issues with page transitions not being easily implemented, and you *KNOW* I want those sweet transition animations!! (but I'll keep 'em short & schweet)\n\nConcerns are plenty, though:\n\n1. I'm very uneasy about using a turnkey solution from a [company](https://vercel.com/)\n1. Not sure whether it will match my way of doing things (although I can probably wrestle with NextJS to make it work!)\n1. Will it stand the test of time?\n1. What about performance? Static generation is cool, but is the frontend package going to be *small* enough?\n\nThe answers in the next few episodes.\n\n`11:45am:` Speaking of episodes, I have had *zero* time to binge on shows, not even discover new YouTube videos. As we're easing into the colder seasons, my focus is into reading. About tech shit, of course, but also about another huge interest of mine: space.\n\nAnd obviously, I have a passion for writing. It may not be interesting, but I like it: it appeases the mind. Eventually if I get better at this and other things, I might share more, and maybe try to gain in visibility. For now however, I'm very happy with tending my own semi-private garden and writing about nothing and everything.\n\n`4:54pm:` Good day today: managed to make some progress on the NextJS experiment. Hopefully tomorrow will be just as productive.\n\nTwo unrelated things I did today:\n\n- Because I switched from a [60%](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=28) keyboard to a [tenkeyless](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=27) keyboard, my escape key now feels a bit too high (it was on the <span class=\"hotkey\">`</span>, or <span class=\"hotkey\">~</span> key instead) so I had remapped *Caps lock* to *Escape*... and that was a mistake. I can't get used to it. My pinky can only do so much, between tabs, the left shift key, the backtick & tilde... it just didn't work for me. I know, I know, this is full-nerd territory, but I read in many places that this is something developers do and I wanted to finally try it. meh.\n- Switched to using the [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) font.

I've got my new remote-work setup almost complete before I go back to work, and it feels great. New screen, [new keyboard](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL) with [silent red MX switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-silent-red.html) to keep things quiet... because now I'm sharing this space with my girlfriend who hates the clicky noises of [my previous keyboard](https://www.kbparadise.com/v60).\n\nThat was super geeky of me, but hey, this is my life, this is what I use every day to put food on the table, so I care deeply about those things. Now I can take it slow, and start working on some great shit!\n\nAt the end of yesterday's entry, I mentioned the [Slow Movement](https://www.slowmovement.com/), something I'm starting to explore. At the risk of sounding really hypocritical, I believe that we should consume less. Right now, I believe I have made consumer choices that will lead to less waste: I will probably enjoy the material goods I bought for far longer and I will enjoy using them far more than if I had settled for the cheaper options. In the future, I will try to buy second-hand products when I can help it. And sell my unused goods at a good price to whoever wants to enjoy them.\n\nAnyway, this is not really the philosophy suggested by the movement; from what I read, it's a response to today's incredibly fast-paced society that we've created for ourselves. You may or may not feel the same way, but lately I have indeed been willing to slow down a little, to let the dust settle *(one of my favorite idioms, haha)*, and, as they put it on their website, to ‚Äústop the world [because] I want to get off‚Äù. If you're tempted to shout ‚ÄúFirst World Problems!!‚Äù at me for writing something like that, well, you would be right. I live comfortably from a home in a First World country, and I find time to write about how the world is going too fast for me, what a pity!\n\nThe truth is that I was born in this machine, and now I realize ‚Äî far too late ‚Äî that it will not go on, that it is not sustainable, that it will instead lead to more pain and suffering. With that, I want to go on living a good life, and spend time thinking about interesting ways out of this global predicament.\n\n`2:34pm:` While reading the [Wikipedia article for the Slow Movement](https://www.slowmovement.com/), I ended rabbit-holeing my way to the [Psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography) page, a concept I first learned while I was studying in Bordeaux and attended a conference in which a speaker described it in enough detail to keep me interested! Basically, it's somewhat related to the Slow Movement, in that it promotes [\"drifting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive) through the streets (and landmarks) of a city, without a destination, simply to observe life, the architecture, the sounds, the smells, etc.\n\nI love it. I like to take walks through the neighborhood and discover new places by chance, just by letting my mind wander, and letting my body follow it.\n\n`8:08pm:` I've been looking at all this **code** today, and I think I'm going to try something with this blog, to make it a little more future-proof. I don't know yet if it's gonna be good. Time will tell!\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":1,"commentId":"2020-10-06_1"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":2,"commentId":"2020-10-06_2"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":3,"commentId":"2020-10-06_3"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":4,"commentId":"2020-10-06_4"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":5,"commentId":"2020-10-06_5"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":6,"commentId":"2020-10-06_6"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":7,"commentId":"2020-10-06_7"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":8,"commentId":"2020-10-06_8"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":9,"commentId":"2020-10-06_9"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":10,"commentId":"2020-10-06_10"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":11,"commentId":"2020-10-06_11"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":12,"commentId":"2020-10-06_12"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":13,"commentId":"2020-10-06_13"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":14,"commentId":"2020-10-06_14"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":15,"commentId":"2020-10-06_15"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":16,"commentId":"2020-10-06_16"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":17,"commentId":"2020-10-06_17"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":18,"commentId":"2020-10-06_18"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":19,"commentId":"2020-10-06_19"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":20,"commentId":"2020-10-06_20"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":21,"commentId":"2020-10-06_21"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":22,"commentId":"2020-10-06_22"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":23,"commentId":"2020-10-06_23"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":24,"commentId":"2020-10-06_24"},{"entryId":"2020-10-06","index":25,"commentId":"2020-10-06_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/10/05/back-to-basics.md","meta":{"title":"Back To Basics","description":"Full one-eighty","tags":"update, thoughts","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2020-10-05/back-to-basics","url":"/blog/2020-10-05/back-to-basics","date":"2020-10-05","id":"back-to-basics","year":"2020","month":"10","day":"05","prettyDate":"October 05, 2020","archive":"October 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Siphon","url":"/blog/2020-10-01/siphon","description":"Still at it, sometimes..."}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Another Tuesday","url":"/blog/2020-10-06/another-tuesday","description":"I'm settling in slowly!"}}},"content":"`10:13am:` Some little time alone, and I want to start writing some shit on this blog!\n\nThese days, it almost feels like I'm going back to school, back to my early years of wonder: the World is mysterious, nobody understands it, nobody gives a shit, most people just chugging along, trying their best, etc. and me in the middle, doing the same thing, but maybe also reflecting on what to do, why, how, and feeling *strange* about a lot of stuff. I feel like a kid.\n\nRecently, I've turned a closet into some sort of workstation where I'll be tinkering with all kinds of shit, time permitting of course! And I've equipped myself so that working from home won't feel like I'm locked in a drab prison cell. I have goals, projects, hopes & fears; thankfully, lately I tend to take my fears and turn them into excitement, and I'm super excited to see what I'm gonna do with all of this.\n\nFor this blog, I finally gave up on the idea of making it super *evolved*: I want it to be barebone, really old school. Real easy to maintain. I want it to look cool, and feel right, improve the UX, etc. while keeping it absolutely ancient in terms of technology. Ideally, I'm aiming for some plain HTML, CSS, Javascript; with maybe an API on the server to handle all that bullshit with creating pages, comments, etc. It'll still be super basic, but fuck you. I want something simple.\n\nNext, I want to set up some sort of **music** section, where I'll be dumping some track drafts, finished or not, samples, weird experiments, anything. I want this dumb blog to be a hodge-podge of all the crap I'm toying with. It'll be fun.\n\nThat's all I'm gonna write today. I still have to push this entry and it's a long process. Ah!

Somehow, I am grateful to have been given this time of incredibly deep reflection, in this time of deep turmoil. I don't pretend to know the answers, but I like to write out my feelings on this blog, maybe as a way to keep a trace of my (and our?) state of mind.\n\nFirst of all, if you're reading this: you're awesome!\n\nWhat I mean is that we're all in this together, and there's no _deus ex machina_ waiting to jump in to save us from this bitter drama. We're human beings, we have neighbors, friends, family. We have jobs, some of us have good jobs which we enjoy and pay good money. We need to keep together, and share that wealth.  Nothing fucks me up more than seeing people adopt a mentality of individualism, of greed... those people won't go far. And they need to be shown the light.\n\nLast year it took all I had to keep it together psychologically. I can't even begin to think about going through this ordeal with as fragile a spirit as I had in October 2019. What changed? A perspective change? Becoming a father? Landing a good job, and working with good people? It probably helped.\n\nI'm still optimistic because I want to believe that, deep down, most of us will follow science, and will try to do the best we can. We need to be calm, get off social media, and nourish our brains with healthy bits and habits. These days our minds are under attack, as some entities (corporations? politicians? governments? lobby groups? I don't give a fuck who) weaponize the Internet for their own gains; I love the web, but we need to claim it back for ourselves. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and many other companies hell-bent on making profits off the backs of the common people... we don't need them. We fucking don't. At this point, the wonderful, magical capabilities of the tools they offer do not outweigh what I would call the \"hidden costs\" of using them.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone whose livelihood depends on these companies! But frankly, this isn't what I signed up for... but I'm one guy. How do we fight back? How do we turn the tide? Am I a tired old bourgeois hipster who doesn't know what he's talking about? YES!

The truth is: the blog is fine.\n\nWhat I miss is: experimentation, and research. I should have tiny \"micro-projects\" with which to experiment on new technologies, to apply their principles on a basic app or whatever, but which would *also* include something I wanted to try... in terms of UX, in terms of design, in terms of UI.\n\nFrom the *funky little projects* pile, I could pick the one about particle physics, where I would explain the basics of particles with 3D models in the browsers, and animations, etc. Obviously, it sounds like nothing to me when I casually give it a thought or two, but in practice I expect this project to require at least two full months of hard work (because they will be spread out to the moments in the day when I'm not on daddy duty)\n\nQuestion is: do I believe the time investment to be wise? Depending on the scope of the project and how it's going in the first few iterations, maybe!\n\n`1:52pm:` The only missing feature for this blog, is a way to edit stuff online, or at least to have a way to quickly add content. I might just refactor this current iteration to: a) use a better templating engine, b) add a *markdown edit* page, c) allow for *server-side compilation*\n\nIt can be done, and guess what, it can be done without React!\n\n`2:23pm:` Those who know me, know that I have had a love affair with [Notion](https://notion.so): it's because it's really great at giving all the necessary tools to build pages that feel *alive*!\n\nAt some point, I even told my girlfriend that Notion could be like a replacement for \"the web\", because it could empower *regular folks* to build personal pages like in the old days. Unlike the old days however, Notion provides a clean UI on most platforms, and all the tools one needs to create a masterpiece.\n\nThey struck a nice balance between being a powerful tool and an overly \"complex\" one. The UI is honestly very simple, although I'll concede that some people still feel somewhat lost at first, especially if they have never used a similar tool before.\n\nAnyways, I don't work for them, I'm not sponsored, etc. you'll probably hear other stories about it in the future if they play their cards right. Seems like they can boost their valuation to hits the stratosphere soon enough. This shit would be the anti-TikTok, haha! For sure kids aren't gonna use Notion, though. At heart, it's still a very business-like application.\n\nThe point is: I want my toolset to help me unleash boundless creativity, and I believe the way to achieve that is to have an *environment* that provides **many** tools that can be used in the same context, using the same principles. Sort of like *addons*, *extensions*, *plugins*, etc. Every piece of the environment would allow for composing, lego-like, your own personal cathedral. If you read a lot on web development, software engineering and the likes, you'll have read something that mentions LEGOs at some point, I'm sure! That's the goal.\n\nGive me a great Notion API, and I'll use it for my backend in a heartbeat!\n\nThen again, I like to build my own tools, so we'll see!\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":1,"commentId":"2020-09-02_1"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":2,"commentId":"2020-09-02_2"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":3,"commentId":"2020-09-02_3"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":4,"commentId":"2020-09-02_4"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":5,"commentId":"2020-09-02_5"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":6,"commentId":"2020-09-02_6"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":7,"commentId":"2020-09-02_7"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":8,"commentId":"2020-09-02_8"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":9,"commentId":"2020-09-02_9"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":10,"commentId":"2020-09-02_10"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":11,"commentId":"2020-09-02_11"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":12,"commentId":"2020-09-02_12"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":13,"commentId":"2020-09-02_13"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":14,"commentId":"2020-09-02_14"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":15,"commentId":"2020-09-02_15"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":16,"commentId":"2020-09-02_16"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":17,"commentId":"2020-09-02_17"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":18,"commentId":"2020-09-02_18"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":19,"commentId":"2020-09-02_19"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":20,"commentId":"2020-09-02_20"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":21,"commentId":"2020-09-02_21"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":22,"commentId":"2020-09-02_22"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":23,"commentId":"2020-09-02_23"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":24,"commentId":"2020-09-02_24"},{"entryId":"2020-09-02","index":25,"commentId":"2020-09-02_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/08/28/refocus.md","meta":{"title":"Refocus","description":"I decided to try and concentrate on other things","tags":"update","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2020-08-28/refocus","url":"/blog/2020-08-28/refocus","date":"2020-08-28","id":"refocus","year":"2020","month":"08","day":"28","prettyDate":"August 28, 2020","archive":"August 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Webpacked to Heck","url":"/blog/2020-08-27/webpacked-to-heck","description":"modern web development tooling"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Will I ever...","url":"/blog/2020-09-02/will-i-ever","description":"...reboot that blog?"}}},"content":"`3:55pm:` Ok so, in light of the previous entries it's fair to say I've been getting increasingly frustrated by this blog-overhaul process and so I've decided to start really slow and small: I'll setup a *beta* version of the blog for live-testing purposes, and I will build it to be as simple and straightforward as I can.\n\nNothing fancy, but I will add to it, bit by bit, little by little.

The mission is to regain control of my medium of choice, to go back to the basics and take back full possession of my virtual environment: the *networked computer*. We **all** use connected devices, be it a cellphone or a laptop, and yet few people can truly claim that they know how their devices' software works! It's cool... I get it, I know it's complicated, and it's the highly technical job of developers and engineers to figure out how to build it and sell it to consumers, so why worry?\n\nBut hold on there... my mission is broader. It's not only computer and software. It's about claiming back control, regain full understanding and knowledge, of most of the technology (in a broad sense) we use in our everyday lives.\n\nDo you know how electricity works? I don't really know; and yet it's behind everything I use, everything that gave me a job and a livelihood.\n\nDo you know how plants grow? How fabric is made? How engines work? etc.\n\nModern society gave us all this stuff, these magical substances and these mighty machines, invented and crafted by experts and those who don't understand them can still use them! It's fine. However, as a developer, I believe I *should* understand every aspect underlying my work. And it's deep. It's deep, and somewhat hidden... literally, in *code*. It's deep, because it now powers platforms that actually shift political power, it's a economic behemoth waking up from a slumber, ready to strike: and what I want, is to be part of the people who get to choose what this giant is going to do, or at least steer the beast toward a benevolent path.\n\nI feel it is our responsibility to gain control of this virtual space before governments or corporations (worse!) wrap their dirty hands around it and choke it. There is much work to be done, and this is why it's fascinating and exciting and inspiring.\n\n`9:47am:` Research avenues to make a change in this space (that's according to my own ideas, which I'm forming as I type this text, haha):\n\n1. teaching the basics, clearly and pragmatically, of computers, programming, etc.\n1. coming up with more \"Free and Open-Source Software\" ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) maintained by people who share the same vision (ties in with teaching programming: you get to train people to maintain the next generations of FOSS)\n1. more broadly: educating people on the promises, limitations, and dangers of modern communication channels (by that I mean: TikTok, Instagram, Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. and their business model, what is at stake, what it adds to your life and how it can be replaced, etc. etc.)\n\nBasically: I'm against those giant corporations unfurling their tentacles to capture every strategic outpost.

Yesterday I thought about robustness and how to build with it in mind; it occured to me that redundancy was one way of building something into a system to make it less prone to catastrophic failures.\n\nI care deeply about what kind of experience a user is having when interacting with an interface. I think \"code execution failures\" (i.e. *bugs*) are obviously very detrimental to the experience of a user. Finding and fixing bugs is a task we find ourselves working on arduously almost every day.\n\nSo far in my career, I've never worked on a project where I had to write \"tests\", which is one way developers have found to make their codebase much more robust (i.e. by letting some code or program \"catch\" your mistakes before users discover them on their own!)\n\nI think tests are cool; but it's still code, and they're only written to test specific bits of logic. I've been thinking about writing something like tests, but *inside* the codebase: the code would attempt to do something, then try to figure out if everything went smoothly.\n\nTo a user, one of the most important things is for the interface to respond appropriately to a given input. And a test will make sure that, given a specific input, the program returns the expected output.\nBut user input is much less specific: it's erratic, somehow unpredictable, and the output that the user expects... might not even be what the test was told to expect.\n\nThere are many *bugs* you won't catch with tests. I feel that constant *use* (i.e. using the program to achieve something) is what ultimately make the most pressing issues apparent. And I want to think about how to make it less frustrating for users to deal with bugs, as they try to use the program.\nPossible research avenues:\n\n1. allow multiple ways of achievings things (lets the user try something else to achieve the desired results)\n1. allow feedback straight from the interface, to inform the developers that something isn't right (lets the developer fix real-life issues)\n    - that can be done using *analytics* (or *tracking*!) but from my experience, all that Google Analytics nonsense is mainly used as a way to show that your program/interface is getting you more money! Am I wrong? I've never been told by any SEO/SEM expert to try and fix my code because of a discrepancy in the tracking data, which I think can and should be done regularly? Maybe it falls within the purview of a web developer? ughhhhh....\n1. write the code in such a way that it loops back on itself, and analyses its own output according to some expectations, and eventually corrects obvious mistakes\n    - or at least informs the user (via a popup or something?) that something might have gone wrong?\n    - or informs the developer that this output might have caused an error (this probably means keeping a record of the user's inputs for troubleshooting purposes, which might constitute a breach of privacy)\n\n`8:43am:` Whoa, I wrote a lot of stuff! And it's geeky stuff, written like I know what I'm talking about! But hey, people... you have to remember this blog is just a repository of random musings and can't be taken seriously (yet?)\n\nHowever, I'll tell you this: about 10 years ago I finished (quit!) my communications studies because I wanted to get to the nitty-gritty of development, to be *doing* the stuff. These days, with the accumulated real-life experience, I want to dip my toes back into the research aspect of it. I wish to, maybe, change the way websites, interfaces, programs, games, etc. are made, by making them **friendlier**.\n\nLet's see if I can!\n\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":1,"commentId":"2020-08-23_1"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":2,"commentId":"2020-08-23_2"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":3,"commentId":"2020-08-23_3"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":4,"commentId":"2020-08-23_4"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":5,"commentId":"2020-08-23_5"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":6,"commentId":"2020-08-23_6"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":7,"commentId":"2020-08-23_7"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":8,"commentId":"2020-08-23_8"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":9,"commentId":"2020-08-23_9"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":10,"commentId":"2020-08-23_10"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":11,"commentId":"2020-08-23_11"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":12,"commentId":"2020-08-23_12"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":13,"commentId":"2020-08-23_13"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":14,"commentId":"2020-08-23_14"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":15,"commentId":"2020-08-23_15"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":16,"commentId":"2020-08-23_16"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":17,"commentId":"2020-08-23_17"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":18,"commentId":"2020-08-23_18"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":19,"commentId":"2020-08-23_19"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":20,"commentId":"2020-08-23_20"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":21,"commentId":"2020-08-23_21"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":22,"commentId":"2020-08-23_22"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":23,"commentId":"2020-08-23_23"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":24,"commentId":"2020-08-23_24"},{"entryId":"2020-08-23","index":25,"commentId":"2020-08-23_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2020/08/19/meditating.md","meta":{"title":"Meditating","description":"time scavenger","tags":"update","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2020-08-19/meditating","url":"/blog/2020-08-19/meditating","date":"2020-08-19","id":"meditating","year":"2020","month":"08","day":"19","prettyDate":"August 19, 2020","archive":"August 2020","previous":{"meta":{"title":"jammed","url":"/blog/2020-08-07/jammed","description":"breathe in, breathe out, edibles in, time out"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"Fatigue","url":"/blog/2020-08-23/fatigue","description":"keeps accumulating!"}}},"content":"`5:20pm:` From now on, the wish is for these updates to be much more factual and \"light\" than the past couple of entries.

First of all, it's clear we're all getting the same treatment, give or take. No matter who you are, today you just can't escape the state of the **world**. Second of all, we're not about to give up the hope of a better **world**, are we?!\n\nWe've just *got* to switch things up, and kick all the best things into high gear, because now's the time.\n\nWe have plenty of time to think about all of this. What are we gonna do? I don't have the answers to that great question. But instead, I think about random stuff. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. This crisis really makes it self-evident that the Internet is what will allow all of us to communicate, share, purchase, entertain ourselves, etc.\nAs a web developer, I feel grateful to find myself in an **industry** that should remain strong despite this time off, and not only that, but to also find myself able to maybe make a difference in people's lives by building a better web.\n1. I think Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality will finally prove to be extremely useful. They will be used in many areas, for professional and entertainment purposes, for productivity purposes, for teaching purposes, and so on to infinity!\n1. Connected cities are needed. Sustainable cities are needed. Democratic and \"just\" cities are needed. We want to live in a highly functioning community without all the dystopian crap.\nFuck corporations, fuck shareholders, fuck profiteers, fuck those greedy bastards trying to amass the most wealth: who got you the amazing things that keep you alive in times like these? Your business acumen? To some extent, sure, I'll give you that, but ultimately the **real deal** is: SCIENCE.\n1. In my conversations, my solution to fix everything that's wrong in the world always ended up being a mix of two fundamental things: education and health. Keep your society filled with *healthy educated people*, and I believe you'll see great things happen in no time.\n1. Of course, science isn't the only thing you need. We also need a lot more COMPASSION. Less individualism. Work hard on yourself, for yourself, but also for the fabled *greater good*.

I'm a bit lost. But being lost also allows you to go anywhere else, right? If you're completely lost, what good does it do to stay put? You gotta move, in any direction, or the direction that you instinctively decide is the right one, at least for now. Being lost and finding one's way has got to be an exercize in trial and error.

I wish I could see something shiny in the distance, a glowing light, warm and inviting... then I would gather all my energy and runs towards that instead.\n\nBut I can't see anything. It's foggy as fuck.\n\nI'm setting goals for myself. I'm setting myself for failure, but failures are merely the steps that lead to success, right? That's the frame of mind I should adopt anyway. Setting a few goals, trying to forget whatever I think *prevents* me from reaching them, trying to **focus** instead.

What some people hear is a basic 4/4 techno beat, and some tacky synths layered on top, and dismiss the genre as boring _‚Äúalways-sounds-the-same‚Äù_ music. The way I use it is when I need to read something, or focus on a task: it's energetic, it's driving, it's repetitive enough not to distract you too much and take your attention away from what you're focussing on.

It sounds great, it's open-source and I like the name, that's dope, but I have personal opinions and/or arguments against even the _idea_ of a social platform:\n\nFacebook used to make me a bit depressed. Why? Because I felt like nothing was happening in my life, and my friends had way more opportunities and energy to attend events, travel, hang out with cool people. Was it all an illusion; and those friends were simply embellishing their mundane daily lives? Possible.\n\nBut ultimately, I don't care. My problem with it was the amount of information I would receive from (and about) the people I followed, the time and brain power it consumed, just to make me feel like shit. In no way did I feel closer to my friends (on the contrary), or more informed (maybe, on the contrary), or more entertained (on the contrary, it bummed me out and made me angry), or anything.\n\nSo I quit. And joining another platform, no matter how open-source, neutral, decentralized, and _cool_ it is, isn't what I'm inclined to do just yet.\n\nThis blog is actually a reaction to it. It's the ultimate selfish move: if you wanna get news from me, this is where you come. You come to me, you don't wait until my avatar catches your eye, buried in a feed among all your friends' vacation pictures, as you scroll endlessly.\n\nAnd I truly don't care if nobody comes.\n\n`11:15am:` I mustn't forget to also make those posts interesting at some point!

But nowadays our cellphones do so many things they ended up replacing our cameras, calendars, newspapers, voice recorders, maps (and GPS), televisions, calculators, etc.\n\n<code class=\"collapse\">\n<button type=\"button\">Show/Hide pseudo-philosophical rant</button>\n\nWhat I think we gain in convenience, practicality, and productivity, we lose in physicality, purposefulness, and mindfulness. At the risk of sounding like an old degenerate, I think having a specific device for each use-case makes the user much more involved with the process. I see this virtualization of our physical devices as a first step towards full acceptance of the coming ‚Äúvirtual reality‚Äù revolution: get people used to _apps_, so that when they're pulled into an ever more virtual world, the idea of replacing physical objects with their digital counterparts will seem very normal, and commonplace. Why own art, candles, a TV, a guitar?... hell, why even have windows and lightbulbs?! Put on your goggles and slip into a bright new world!\n\nThe ultimate down-sizing: objects are broken down to bits, and their digital ersatz are fed back to us!\n\n_Ahem._ Sorry about that. It's probably better to refer to authors who have thought longer and harder about all this... I guess what I'm saying is: I'm scared of the future, because of how boring it might be. But as someone keeps telling me: there's no use in being pessimistic. Being hopeful and ready to face the day is the best attitude to adopt.\n\n</code>\n\n`9:56am:` Dear Future Reader,\n\nIf you haven't noticed already, most of the entries in this blog are the _stream-of-consciousness_ ramblings of a confused nerd. When you see a timestamp next to a paragraph, it means that the content of this new paragraph doesn't nicely follow the previous one: it's a new idea, a _non-sequitur_.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n***\n\n`3:57pm:` Made it back home, I took the bus for the first time in this city. Since it was the middle of the afternoon, it was almost empty but I assume it gets crowded during the classic commuting hours. We'll see how it goes! What a beautiful day it was, too! I feel great.\n\n","comments":[{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":1,"commentId":"2019-03-11_1"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":2,"commentId":"2019-03-11_2"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":3,"commentId":"2019-03-11_3"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":4,"commentId":"2019-03-11_4"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":5,"commentId":"2019-03-11_5"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":6,"commentId":"2019-03-11_6"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":7,"commentId":"2019-03-11_7"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":8,"commentId":"2019-03-11_8"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":9,"commentId":"2019-03-11_9"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":10,"commentId":"2019-03-11_10"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":11,"commentId":"2019-03-11_11"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":12,"commentId":"2019-03-11_12"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":13,"commentId":"2019-03-11_13"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":14,"commentId":"2019-03-11_14"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":15,"commentId":"2019-03-11_15"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":16,"commentId":"2019-03-11_16"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":17,"commentId":"2019-03-11_17"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":18,"commentId":"2019-03-11_18"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":19,"commentId":"2019-03-11_19"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":20,"commentId":"2019-03-11_20"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":21,"commentId":"2019-03-11_21"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":22,"commentId":"2019-03-11_22"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":23,"commentId":"2019-03-11_23"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":24,"commentId":"2019-03-11_24"},{"entryId":"2019-03-11","index":25,"commentId":"2019-03-11_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2019/03/10/untitled.md","meta":{"description":"Picking up new reading material","tags":"journal","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2019-03-10/untitled","url":"/blog/2019-03-10/untitled","date":"2019-03-10","id":"untitled","year":"2019","month":"03","day":"10","prettyDate":"March 10, 2019","archive":"March 2019","previous":{"meta":{"url":"/blog/2019-03-09/untitled","description":"Everyday chores, every day bores"}},"next":{"meta":{"title":"The Quest Begins","url":"/blog/2019-03-11/the-quest-begins","description":"Feels like I'm chasing the dragon, trying not to get burnt."}}},"content":"`7:52pm:` A literal walk in the park today, through the wind and rain.

So I guess I'm rich.\n\nBut anyway, these days I try to streamline my life, and get rid of things that are... while definitely interesting and entertaining from the first instant, are also sucking my precious time into their vortex. I'm of course talking about social media again, about YouTube and reddit and others. Big surprise!\n\nHow do I go about doing that? First of all, I think about what I want to do with my time, with my life. It's super tough for me because I don't know 100% yet, I'm a bit aimless, and this is why it's so easy for those ‚Äúinfinite content‚Äù websites to hog all of my free time. Back when I was a teen, I thought it was super _cool_ of me not to watch TV anymore, and actually seek content online, things I truly want to know about. And nowadays I'm using the web like I'd be watching TV: letting myself drift on a handful of channels, gobbling up the content, jumping from one to the other every minute...\n\nFor sure the internet is great when you have an interest, a passion, or something to build and you seek out a community, and wikis or other knowledge repositories. These days I'm not too focused on anything particular so I'm trying to shake all that complacency off of me, and concentrate on what's important to me.\n\nMeditation sure helps; there seems to be some sort of trend that started around mindfulness, and I think it's great. But it's even easier than that, really: just sit there, do nothing, and look a bit aimlessly at your surroundings, and you let yourself think about your problems, and then let the flow of your thoughts take you wherever. To me, simply doing this feels good, it feels like it's reparative, and constructive.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem, I think: YouTube, Instagram, reddit, and really, any \"feed-like\" website providing heaps of content will just keep you so busy, so entertained, so satisfied with so much new shiny tidbits, that you'll forget how to be bored, and how it's actually a _great_ thing to be bored.\n\nBeing bored is amazing. It's starting from zero, and it forces you to consider what it is you truly want to do next.\n\nI remember being a kid and going to visit my grandmother in the countryside, and there was no internet, no computer, no videogames. I would feel a bit bored for a minute, but then I'd find something to do: draw, read magazines, do collages, and other less creative things of course, but usually it's the creative things that were the most gratifying.\n\nIt's a bit difficult to force yourself into this _low-stimulus_ state, and willingly manufacture a situation where there's a dearth of entertaining activities.

But of course, things are set in motion that will force me to take action and get it done!\n\nMusic isn't what I pursued for my career, because I was so cowardly and alone that it was out of the question to find a band to practice with (I was learning to play drums) and with school getting a bit harder for me, I finally cracked and let it go at around age 13-14. What a fu~~cking~~ waste! Right at that age when it's recommended to take on some hobby to hang out with like-minded people, I instead decided to retire and dig myself in deeper, doubled-down on PC videogames, dabbled in digital art and sound design before realizing that this \"web\" thing was gonna get **big**! (note: it did got pretty big)\n\nArt and music are central to my life, even though you wouldn't immediately see it. Emotions conveyed through music is the single most important thing to my existence. Other forms of art are cool too, but they don't move me like music does. And it's a shame I didn't pursue it further.\nMaybe it was a way to protect that hobby.\n\n`9:40am:` I'm reluctant to post images on this blog (it's supposed to be a minimalist website, almost 100% text-based) but here are two pictures from my current location: [Picture of street](/files/pictures/travel_2019_02_19.jpg) | [Picture of mountain](/files/pictures/travel_mtn_2019_02_18.jpg)\n\n_Developer rant ahead:_ my blog is a reaction to how bloated web pages have become. I really wanted it to be light, and use as little funky little widgets as possible. I have a little bit of javascript happening, and I'll expand it as days go by and I need to impress my audience (*haha!*) but if it becomes too large, I'll figure out a way to chop it up into bits and only use the bits I need. I was tempted to come up with an image viewer for the pictures above, and it would be, like, **fun** to develop it, but also a bit superfluous: just click on the image, it opens in your browser, you can see it, zoom on it, whatever, save it.\n\n[Keep It Small & Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)\n\n`5:17pm:` Sent some emails, managed my life, has a nano-crisis with the SO. All good now.\n\nWalking back, I realized I really don't take pictures. I was gonna say \"I don't take pictures anymore\" but I don't know if I ever did take pictures constantly when walking around? Nowadays, even in new environment, if nothing truly fascinating is happening, I just won't immortalize anything. What those eyes of mine have seen... I'll take to my grave.\n\n`7:45pm:` Feeling great about this nerdy blog. As I type these lines, it's not exactly live yet but I will have to road test it some more before taking it for a spin in actual real-life conditions. I think it's also lacking a bit of whimsy, a bit of magic to it... and it's an element about which I'm *lowkey* thinking about, incubating the idea of something special to sprinkle over the usual boredom of everyday *blah blah*.\n\nGoing out to play pool now, cheerio.","comments":[{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":1,"commentId":"2019-02-19_1"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":2,"commentId":"2019-02-19_2"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":3,"commentId":"2019-02-19_3"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":4,"commentId":"2019-02-19_4"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":5,"commentId":"2019-02-19_5"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":6,"commentId":"2019-02-19_6"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":7,"commentId":"2019-02-19_7"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":8,"commentId":"2019-02-19_8"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":9,"commentId":"2019-02-19_9"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":10,"commentId":"2019-02-19_10"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":11,"commentId":"2019-02-19_11"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":12,"commentId":"2019-02-19_12"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":13,"commentId":"2019-02-19_13"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":14,"commentId":"2019-02-19_14"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":15,"commentId":"2019-02-19_15"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":16,"commentId":"2019-02-19_16"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":17,"commentId":"2019-02-19_17"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":18,"commentId":"2019-02-19_18"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":19,"commentId":"2019-02-19_19"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":20,"commentId":"2019-02-19_20"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":21,"commentId":"2019-02-19_21"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":22,"commentId":"2019-02-19_22"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":23,"commentId":"2019-02-19_23"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":24,"commentId":"2019-02-19_24"},{"entryId":"2019-02-19","index":25,"commentId":"2019-02-19_25"}]},{"_filePath":"./content/blog/2019/02/16/on-tour.md","meta":{"title":"On Tour","description":"Vacationing, traveling, moving, and all those things","tags":"journal","type":"post","destination":"./public/blog/2019-02-16/on-tour","url":"/blog/2019-02-16/on-tour","date":"2019-02-16","id":"on-tour","year":"2019","month":"02","day":"16","prettyDate":"February 16, 2019","archive":"February 2019","previous":{"meta":{"title":"Squeeze Me Like A Lime, Mash Me Like A Guacamole","url":"/blog/2019-02-11/squeeze-me-mash-me","description":"Goodbye, goodbye y'all!
