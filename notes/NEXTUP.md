# What's next?

1. improve build pipeline
  - esbuild JS
  - straight node-sass for CSS
  - straight copying of assets, I don't give a fuck
2. filtering of *bookmarks* by `tag` (and then, posts, pages, etc. anything)
3. better homepage (just links, and more obvious links)

# Nice-to-haves, but boring to implement (imo)

1. RSS feed
2. sitemap.xml generator?

# Dreamzone / Experimental

1. search functionality
2. page content builder using JSON modules
3. a visual sitemap/graph, interactive, funky, beautiful, fun, and... useful!?
