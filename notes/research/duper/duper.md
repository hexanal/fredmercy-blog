# Duper

- an HTML editor in the browser
- a way to compose pages visually with a more... modular interface?
- a way to think about *components* a different way

## idea pile, number 1

- a *DOM tree* view
  - see what's going on in your page, in terms of HTML tags, HTML "structure"
  - think: "outline" view in VS Code, but with more interactivity (*explained below*)
- a *source code* view
  - that's the actually rendered HTML code
- a *preview* pane
  - takes the HTML output and dunks it into a region of the editor
