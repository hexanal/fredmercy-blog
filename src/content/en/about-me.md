## about me

* 🏷 I'm a developer, mainly *frontend web* developer. I like to think I also know a lot about UX and design; and philosophy, biology, chemistry, politics, economics, etc. but maybe I really don't know anything at all.
* 📍 I live in Montreal. I'm originally from France. I traveled; I don't know who I am.
* 🎚 Bandcamp profile: [fredmercy.bandcamp.com](https://fredmercy.bandcamp.com)
* 🐤 My personal Twitter: [@hexanal](https://twitter.com/hexanal)
  - why `hexanal`, though?
    - because I'm into weird, quirky and nerdy stuff, and this is in fact the name of a [molecule](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hexanal). Six atoms of carbon, twelve hydrogen, one oxygen.
    - also I liked the word [hex](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hex)
    - some people are weirded out by the `-anal` suffix, but are super comfortable with `canal`, `analysis`, `banal`, etc. so I don't see the problem, guys 🤷‍♂️
