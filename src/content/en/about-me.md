## about me

* I'm a developer, mainly *frontend web* developer. I like to think I also know a lot about UX and design; and philosophy, biology, chemistry, politics, economics, etc. but maybe I really don't know anything at all.
* I live in Montreal. I'm originally from France. I traveled; I don't know who I am.
* Bandcamp profile: [fredmercy.bandcamp.com](https://fredmercy.bandcamp.com)
* My personal Twitter: [@hexanal](https://twitter.com/hexanal)
