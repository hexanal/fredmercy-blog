## about me

I'm interested in: an open web & programming, reading, art, and [blogging](/blog)

I'm an average _dude_ (he/him/whatever); and like most of you, I'm a human being and I'm trying to give meaning to my short existence.

I'm also a web developer currently looking for work; [here's my resume](/resume).

## about this website

**preferences:** <a href="/help" data-component="emit" data-event="SHOW_BOX_HELP">site settings and preferences</a>

**_raison d'être:_**

- hosting my [blog](/blog)
- showcasing my web experiments *(coming soon!)*
- and more generally: it's a (public) brain dump, a repository of my notes

**technology**

- hosted by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
  - ubuntu 16.04
  - nginx
  - nodejs/express
- made by me
  - open sourced [on github](https://github.com/hexanal/fredmercy-blog), you can read the `README.md` file for more technical information
  - its design is minimalist on purpose: the goal is to have a website that runs smoothly on almost any hardware, that's accessible, performant, legible, easy to maintain, etc.

If you have any question, feel free to [contact me](mailto:hello@fredmercy.ca).
