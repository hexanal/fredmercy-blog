## about me

I'm interested in: an open web & programming, reading, art, and [blogging](/blog)

I'm an average _dude_ (he/him/whatever); and like most of you, I'm a human being and I'm trying to give meaning to my short existence.

I'm also a web developer currently looking for work; [here's my resume](/resume).

## about this website

**preferences:** <a href="/help" data-component="emit" data-event="SHOW_BOX_HELP">site settings and preferences</a>

**_raison d'√™tre:_**

- hosting my [blog](/blog)
- showcasing my web experiments *(coming soon!)*
- and more generally: it's a (public) brain dump, a repository of my notes

**technology**

- hosted by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
  - ubuntu 16.04
  - nginx
  - nodejs/express
- made by me
  - open sourced [on github](https://github.com/hexanal/fredmercy-blog), you can read the `README.md` file for more technical information
  - its design is minimalist on purpose: the goal is to have a website that runs smoothly on almost any hardware, that's accessible, performant, legible, easy to maintain, etc.

**comments**

You will see a ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù button in the lower-right corner of every page. The discussion box isn't account-based and is open to anyone. Any abuse will lead to the removal of the feature altogether and possibly the loss of submitted comments as well! _Stay courteous!_

For more personal comments or other questions, feel free to [contact me directly](mailto:hello@fredmercy.ca).

**privacy**

- I don't use cookies to track you, but I do use a browser feature called [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) which helps this website remember your preferences:
  1. the name you enter in the comment box
  2. any unsubmitted message in the comment box
  3. your preferred font size
  4. your preferred theme
- you can leave comments on any page of this website
  - if you want anonymity, just don't use your real name
  - you can spam the comments, but please don't do it because **it's not nice**

**tracking**

- there's a session cookie that the server uses but honestly... I don't know what it does ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- otherwise, I don't do any tracking
