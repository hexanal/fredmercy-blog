`10:05am:` It's always surprising to meet someone you've communicated online with for years, and pick up the conversation right away, almost from where you left off. I guess this is like the concept of _pen pals_. I've had the experience a few times, meeting _close online friends_ in “real life” and it's really interesting to see how someone's personality is revealed in much more vivid details than when you can only try to imagine when talking to that person online.

Sometimes it makes me wonder what I leave out (or add) to my own personality when I communicate online. With this blog for instance, I want to be as honest, candid, and naive as I can. I want it to be a pure form of communication, disregarding the expectations of possible readers, disregarding the _rules_ of editing even. It's also a bit selfish: I write for myself (as evidenced by the fact I write these entries and don't publish them right away, and my blog is not really _advertised_ to anyone anywhere).
