`10:02am:` It's definitely the case that I'm afflicted with the [SAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder); okay, so it's self-diagnosed, but it sure does explain my mood. When the sun shines, it's as if I could accomplish anything, and take on any challenge. But when it's overcast and grey, it's like the world is ending and nothing matters.

When I was younger, it was like a hobby of mine to try and see what kind of mental disorder(s) I might have. As it turns out, I think the answer is as easy as: depends on the _weather_, dude! Nothing fancy.

By the way, the title of this entry is based on track 4 from [Morgan Delt](https://www.last.fm/music/Morgan+Delt)'s album [_Phase Zero_](https://morgandelt.bandcamp.com/album/phase-zero).<sup data-note="I've been meaning to buy that LP for ages, but with all the traveling and the “not having a record player at home” thing, I still haven't commited. But it's a really good album, very mellow, very psychedelic.">[1]</sup>

`4:33pm:` And speaking of sun, man, today was a wonderful day! Pure bliss.

`9:28pm:` Random stupid thought: something becomes interesting when it's fed into itself. Recursion. Takes the output and feed it back as the input. So _meta_! Exactly, bro. This is _elevated_ shit right here, once you go meta, you're in a whole 'nother realm!

I was so bad at math, and recursion caused me trouble when we were taught it in school! Now I love it. They don't show enough visual representations of mathematical concepts in school, I think. At least, when I was a kid, they sure as heck didn't.
