description: Stuck in suspended animation, a weird anxious feeling of finally being able to do all the things I've been meaning to do

`9:23am:` Woke up early because of the heat. Just thought I'd post a blog entry just to let y'all know I'm still alive. It's simply hard to get going on my projects while I'm battling with this weird anxiety, and being “on-the-road-but-not-really”.

It's tough to see months go by and it feels like nothing gets done, nothing changes, like, am I even doing anything right? Am I even moving in any direction?

But anyway, I try to keep my spirits high despite that, I enjoy the day; been thinking of giving meditation another shot, and with my living situation getting a little more stable, I might also settle into some kind of routine that allows for better mental health, and better creative output. I don't know! We'll see!
