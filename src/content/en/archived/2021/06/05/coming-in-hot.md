`2:24pm:` It's summer, I'm sitting on the porch writing for my blog, and taking the time to answer emails.

Things are hectic. I'm working hard as ever and I'm redlining the old engine, which is a familiar feeling for me because I've been in this situation a bunch of times. This year, between the pandemic, raising a daughter and switching jobs, I've unearthed some of my demons and even met new ones along the way. Somehow I'm good, though, because as I said: I've *been through this shit before* and I ain't dead yet.

Taking the subway again and walking through the city makes me realize how many souls are out there doing the same thing: trying to make a living, trying to feel good.

I hope we all succeed.
