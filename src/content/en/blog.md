## November 1

`that morning ~ 10am:`

Ouchie! ğŸ’¢ Not again! ğŸ›‘ I don't know when it happened but my blues came back sometime at the end of summer, when I thought I was _burnt-out_ because I swear I could smell my brain getting roasted! Hurtful memories are surfacing, nagging me, telling me I can never be any good. A weird anxiety turns me into a socially inept dweeb. Bouts of anger that are obviously part of some lizard-brain defense mechanism make me sound like a short-fused moron.

Yesterday was Halloween night, under the rain, in the darkness, getting individually wrapped bullshit candy, walking past neighbors having fun with their cool friends. I even decided to skip the Halloween party with the work peeps Friday, having opted to slip back into lukewarm depression instead.

Amongst those other things, I'm expecting my second child. ğŸ‘¶

It's magic. It's black magic. Like an effin' curse, guys! ğŸ”®

`12:12pm:` Bad habits die hard, but this week I'm killing them. Serial killing of bad habits. I'm firing every bad habit and I'll hire new, better habits. I need a change.

Glad I finally started that playlist thing. I need to advertise my work as musical art curator. The Fred Mercy monthly playlist... Maybe nobody cares, but it's cool y'all, because I don't really care that much either, ah!

Revisiting the [FEBRUARY2015](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WE9JsAdjhBFFLrEVdttBi?si=07b2a2e896384c3a) playlist right now. Man, it's trippy as heck. Not all good songs, but *it's aight*.

## Music!
