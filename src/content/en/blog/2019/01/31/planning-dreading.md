`11:25am:` Most of the morning spent on planning my short-term future: travel plans, moving out, in, insurance, temporary accomodations, etc. Anxiety is creeping, my psoriasis is flaring, but the World keeps on turning.

Been reading a bit on music theory, I'm starting to understand and assimilate the concepts. Now, it's all about performing and sight reading music, and a lot of it. I need a keyboard, _presto_.

Looking at my macOS weather widgets: -16ºC here, 16ºC there... **ugh!**

It's all good though.

Oh, and by the way, check out today's track:

- [_Cyboogie_, by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/track/cyboogie)
- [...and the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_un9PYsE1_g)

`1:17pm:` Nice little life events _loop_ right now: buying tickets for a show overseas while in the same exact coffee shop from which I had ordered tickets for our first ever King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard show, which was also overseas. We be travelin'! Loving it.
