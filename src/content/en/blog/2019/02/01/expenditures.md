`11:54am:` Thinking of spending inordinate amounts of money on material goods, while thinking about saving money in order to survive the future. Damn this dumb dilemma.

Also: Happy Friday!

`1:44pm:` Doing very little. But doing very little every day, it adds up!

`3:34pm` Not producing anything is making me anxious; I should have a schedule for consistent creative output.
