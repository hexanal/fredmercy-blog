`10:23am:` Good productivity streak yesterday with that weird comment slot system. Funny how I can be super efficient when it comes to building random stupid things, but when it comes to working on things that will end up with me actually getting paid, I'm utterly unmotivated.

[some deleted content here, sorry]

`4:54pm:` Found this cool thing on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), by [Seanitzel](https://www.reddit.com/user/Seanitzel), which allows you to browse pretty much any scale you want along with its associated chords. I think it's pretty sweet: [Musitelligence](https://musitelligence.com)
