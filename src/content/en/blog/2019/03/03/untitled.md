`5:40pm:` Spending a great grey & rainy Sunday working on some skill tests, trying to earn a living in this old town. It comes as a nice way for me to focus on something else other than running around solving administrative issues, and stimulates my neurons a little bit before hopping back on that saddle.

With all of that, I'm still eager to get started with other creative things, and get the juices flowing. Hopefully I'll get in that headspace quickly enough.
