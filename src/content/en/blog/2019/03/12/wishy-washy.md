`3:27pm:` Watched [The Thirteenth Floor (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809) yesterday. What's the deal with all those “real life is a simulation” movies which popped up around that year? [eXistenZ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907), [The Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093), [Dark City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929), etc. I mean, wow!
