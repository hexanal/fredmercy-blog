`3:14pm:` Maybe blaming my non-productivity on all those administrative tasks I have to go through is a way for me to justify my laziness? to find a scapegoat for my inability to sit down and do good work? or for something else that prevents me from finally get to it?

To say that I'm psychologically in a tight spot would be an understatement, as far as I'm concerned. I think it's “good so far” but that... some very heavy things are haphazardly piled on top of other more fragile things which might buckle under the pressure at any instant.

I make it sound ominous and more serious than it probably is; but what do you want? I have a way with words, I know how to make a sentence very... concerning.

`3:27pm:` Watched [The Thirteenth Floor (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809) yesterday. What's the deal with all those “real life is a simulation” movies which popped up around that year? [eXistenZ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907), [The Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093), [Dark City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929), etc. I mean, wow!

`7:12pm:` Ok, damn. I'm ready. I'm ready now.
