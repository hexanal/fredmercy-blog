`6:48pm:` Oh wow, so first off, I finished a hard day's work, the sun is setting, clothes are drying, everything is great. And second: oh my, oh my, there is so much new stuff I've discovered lately, and I love when that happens.

I checked out [httpster](http://httpster.net) for some website inspiration and, following some _“website by”_ link in some website's footer, I ended up on some guy's website... and this guy probably never sleeps. Probably lives and breathes _creative code_. Anyway, here's [their website](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#home)<sup data-note="I use the “their” pronoun here because that's what they use on the website, so, I don't know, maybe they're gender fluid, prefer this pronoun, or it's a group of people... I don't know">[1]</sup> and it's pretty crazy.

So there's a lot of stuff in there. Mostly a ton of tiny app/program available on Github, but also links to what they use everyday, software, hardware and other accessories. That's cool.

And so, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neauoire), I fall further down the rabbit hole and [I end up on this](http://bildwissenschaft.vortok.info/the-dispossessed/) which I found super funny because I'm reading this book right now! now I have a soundtrack for it

All that certainly reignites my willingness to get weird, get creative, get musical, with my projects. I really like the aesthetic, the minimalism of it all. It makes me think about maybe creating a Bookmarks page on the blog where I list all the links I've posted. Sounds like a cool and easy idea.

Another thing I found out right when I opened Twitter, is this fucking thing:

These boys can do no wrong!

`8:56pm:` What the heck! I went ahead and started working on a "bookmarks" page. It's very barebone, but I guess it does the trick, for now!
