`11:48am:` If I've still got nothing to share on this here blog, to be honest, it's because of personal issues that seem so insurmountable that I let it all go adrift, and calling this downtime “taking some time off” or worse: “some time to think”.

This doesn't feel real, because it isn't, obviously. If I'm typing this for my blog, it's for my own, ah, entertainment. Or is it a cry for help? I wouldn't pay no mind to a reaching helping hand anyway. The answer is a choice, but a hard choice. Turns out a “hard choice” is in fact a very *easy* choice (in that it's clear it's the right one) but one that has far-reaching consequences, made all the more difficult by the uncertainty of it all... by that I mean, it's unknown how well I would handle the consequences of this choice.

But anyway, the hope for now is to channel all of that into some creative outlet (let's say, music?) and exorcise the demons in a productive way. Keep playing or the Devil will enslave your soul! Haha.

Look, I get it: it's not cool to be talking about sad shit. I don't want that.  But I think it's telling that I *still* feel some sort of sick urge to write about it... maybe it's just the first step of this exorcism?
