`11:38am:` Maybe this is how shit gets done in the Universe? A break, a fissure in time, a cataclysm, or something inescapable somehow forces the flow of timespace to take an unexpected new path, but now with more pressure, more velocity, to carve out something much deeper.

Well, I don't know... I'm a bit lost. But being lost also allows you to go anywhere else, right? If you're completely lost, what good does it do to stay put? You gotta move, in any direction, or the direction that you instinctively decide is the right one, at least for now. Being lost and finding one's way has got to be an exercize in trial and error. Walk a few miles, look around, map out the area; what do you see? Is it promising? Is there something you think you might need, something you might want over there? Well go on, then!

So I've been walking towards learning music theory. I'm not running towards it, you know... I'm steadily walking towards it at a very leisurely pace. Picking up things as I go. I might stop, I might turn around. I might find a better path, maybe a fork in the road ahead. Whatever. I wish I could see something shiny in the distance, a glowing light, warm and inviting... then I would gather all my energy and runs towards that instead.

But I can't see anything. It's foggy as fuck.

I'm setting goals for myself. I'm setting myself for failure, but failures are merely the steps that lead to success, right? That's the frame of mind I should adopt anyway. Setting a few goals, trying to forget whatever I think *prevents* me from reaching them, trying to **focus** instead. Focus, motivation, determination, perseverance, a can-do attitude, optimism, stubbornness... what to do to exhibit those qualities? I mean... I'm already stubborn, but *optimistic*? Fuck no. And determined? Focused? Not nearly enough.

It's hard work.

`12:05pm:` Wondering about maybe getting a radically different haircut.
