`4:11pm:` Woah... I'm really in some strange state of mind. I'm trying to plop my ass at my desk and squeeze the creative juices as much as I can... at the same time I really let myself take my time, freely play, and record and arrange randomly until I *feel* it. But so far, I've got nothing really solid. Nothing has gelled yet. Maybe that's because I've got no clear concept, and no real drive to, uh, *extrude* an emotion or a feeling, you know? Usually I've got something in mind, I've got some weird quirky visual that goes along with it. This time... right now at least, I've got nothing!

BUT... it might come. Has to happen in the midst of all this bullshit!

I can't believe that it's October already, and I've posted only twice in September when I truly thought I was gonna have at least one mediocre song to share on this blog before the end of the month. Don't even hold your breath for a song in October, at that pace it's gonna be a Christmas miracle if I release one crappy song before the end of the year.

`4:26pm:` I've been watching Seinfeld, catching up with, you know... cultural references and shit. It's hilarious.
