`11:41am:` Some days you just wanna crawl down a cave and die, you know. And other days, you're ready to take on the world! That's life, I guess. Well, I'm living that bitch of a life, and it ain't easy everyday but there's always that faint flickering beacon of hope in the distance; you can barely make it out but you know it's there. Even if you can only see the halo of that light, scattering through the dark clouds on the horizon, that fucking light is always shining, and you just gotta keep moving toward it.

I have to stay focused, determined. I have to weather that damn storm.

Also, I bought a new instrument, and I'm weighing the pros and cons of buying
yet another! I'm crazy. I'm dumb. I'm free.

`4:43pm:` Just a quick to let y'all know I've officially tasted what I now consider the best burger in this city! Those who know me know that I'm a burger afficionado, and I'm always down to try a new spot. Today I visited a restaurant I already knew and loved, but I'd never tasted their Big Mac™ *ersatz*... oh boy, what a kickass burger!
