`8:42am:` It's a global pandemic, so we're quarantined for who knows how long, and that gives me some time to try and update my blog.

I'm lucky enough to be able to work from home, so I'll use that extra time gained from not commuting to play some MUSIC.

I bought a guitar, a tuner pedal, cables, I've got my bass, my drums... I'm all set to write some tunes. That'll keep my mind busy on something creative!

Stay safe out there people. I love you.
