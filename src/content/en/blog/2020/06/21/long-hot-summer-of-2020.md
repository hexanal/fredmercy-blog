`10:57am:` I have to apologize. While I was trying to update this blog, I inadvertently *nuked this whole server into orbit*.

All the files, all the configuration, and since the "database" I use for comments was based on the file system... I lose those, too! It wasn't a lot of comments, but they were yours; they were mine. Now they're lost in time, like tears in... rain.

Updating this blog is a tedious, long-winded, tortuous process... **but** I'm updating this blog to make it easier to read, easier to maintain, easier to update, easier to navigate, easier to love.

*Hang tight!*
