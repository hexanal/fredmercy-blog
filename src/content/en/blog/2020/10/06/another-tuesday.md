`11:07am:` Yo, this is cool. I've got my new remote-work setup almost complete before I go back to work, and it feels great. New screen, [new keyboard](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL) with [silent red MX switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-silent-red.html) to keep things quiet... because now I'm sharing this space with my girlfriend who hates the clicky noises of [my previous keyboard](https://www.kbparadise.com/v60).

That was super geeky of me, but hey, this is my life, this is what I use every day to put food on the table, so I care deeply about those things. Now I can take it slow, and start working on some great shit!

At the end of yesterday's entry, I mentioned the [Slow Movement](https://www.slowmovement.com/), something I'm starting to explore. At the risk of sounding really hypocritical, I believe that we should consume less. Right now, I believe I have made consumer choices that will lead to less waste: I will probably enjoy the material goods I bought for far longer and I will enjoy using them far more than if I had settled for the cheaper options. In the future, I will try to buy second-hand products when I can help it. And sell my unused goods at a good price to whoever wants to enjoy them.

Anyway, this is not really the philosophy suggested by the movement; from what I read, it's a response to today's incredibly fast-paced society that we've created for ourselves. You may or may not feel the same way, but lately I have indeed been willing to slow down a little, to let the dust settle *(one of my favorite idioms, haha)*, and, as they put it on their website, to “stop the world because I want to get off”. If you're tempted to shout “First World Problems!!” at me for writing something like that, well, you would be right. I live comfortably from a home in a First World country, and I find time to write about how the world is going too fast for me, what a pity!

The truth is that I was born in this machine, and now I realize — far too late — that it will not go on, that it is not sustainable, that it will instead lead to more pain and suffering. With that, I want to go on living a good life, and spend time thinking about interesting ways out of this global predicament.

`2:34pm:` While reading the [Wikipedia article for the Slow Movement](https://www.slowmovement.com/), I ended rabbit-holeing my way to the [Psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography) page, a concept I first learned while I was studying in Bordeaux and attended a conference in which a speaker described it in enough detail to keep me interested! Basically, it's somewhat related to the Slow Movement, in that it promotes ["drifting"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive) through the streets (and landmarks) of a city, without a destination, simply to observe life, the architecture, the sounds, the smells, etc.

I love it. I like to take walks through the neighborhood and discover new places by chance, just by letting my mind wander, and letting my body follow it.

`8:08pm:` I've been looking at all this **code** today, and I think I'm going to try something with this blog, to make it a little more future-proof. I don't know yet if it's gonna be good. Time will tell!
