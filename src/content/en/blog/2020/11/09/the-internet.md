`9:27pm:` It's getting late, I've been working all day on some bullshit website issues, and I'm still on the internet. Let me just say... I'm dizzy. It's time to take a break before I slam my fists on the table and I start yelling: <span style="display: inline-block; padding-bottom: 0.25rem; font-style: italic; border-bottom: 2px solid currentColor; transform: rotate(-2deg);">I WANT TO QUIT!</span> as it happens every now and then.

I love the idea of a network, I like the web, I like technology. But sometimes... woah. It's too much.

So I'm gonna read a book.
