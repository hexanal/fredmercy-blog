I'm making soup and wanted to wish y'all Happy Holidays!

Despite the dwindling stocks of herbal medication, it's been chill here. Well, okay... my mood's been swinging wildly and it felt like I was losing my mind for a second, but look: everything's all good now. It looks like I've been stretching myself quite thin these days! _[note: i'm talking “one-atom-thick” Fred right here, you could call me graphene]_

Locked some vacation time during which I intend to do what I do best: sitting on own ass doing nothing, haha! Man, I surely hope not 'cause I have a bunch of things I wanted to take care of:

- connect with family and friends more
- get some rest and watch good movies
- try to set up a mild exercise routine
- write more content for the website
- continue the redesign, UX overhaul, performance measurements, etc.
- dive back into more “creative” hobbies
  - sound design, music, drawing, and so on
- experiment with wacky frontend dev shit

All of those are pretty much my New Year's resolutions; it's a work in progress and definitely stuff I want to have dialed perfectly. No pressure though.

Still thinking about having a better search/filter system so that readers could toggle the "developer" talk on and off. Some days I want to write about frontend development, some other days science and technology, and most of time... about my pathetic existence :)
