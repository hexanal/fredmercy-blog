`8:25pm:`

I'm writing a little something since it's not too late; in a few minutes I'll be dead asleep because my workdays are sapping my energy.

There is something I want to do, which is to give back to the World. I want to do something good; I live to create, to build, to give birth to new ideas. I have taken and taken from the world and never gave back. Years and years have passed during which I wondered why I felt so wrong: it's because I rarely shared.

On this blog, I will try to talk about my quest for a better world, for a better understanding of *Life, the Universe and everything*. You may read or you may not and it's fine. But I'm driven to write by some mysterious force. I can't explain it. I want to do something while I can.

`8:47pm:`

It was already too late for me to make sense: I'm incoherent. I'm all over the place.

I'm a human being, lost in space and time. Questioning everything, paralyzed by analysis. Existential crisis. I'm drinking herbal tea. I should be playing music but I forgot today's Thursday.

You're witnessing someone probably suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder, or whatever it is... days are short, they say, yet I'm working the same old 7.5h every day, wasting my time on bullshit. I'm burning out.

About this website: I'll bring some of my notes over to the web, in a new "Notes" section. There will probably be a lot of cleaning up to do, and some programming _(note: by that I mean: new HTML templates, which really isn't programming, let's be honest)_ to do to display all of that correctly. If the Universe is kind, I might have some more free time soon.

Later, I'll be adding even more shit on the website. But... later.
