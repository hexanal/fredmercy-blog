description: What's coming next?

`7:01pm:` Lately, I might have been reading a little too much [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (guess I've found my new internet addiction) but from what I've been reading developers seem to be a bit [fed up with the state of the web](https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html), and of [web browsers](https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html)[*](both links were found on hacker news, of course)

I'm always trying to make cool sh~~i~~t on the web. But the tools feel wrong: they are clunky, not super intuitive, all over the place, maybe even counter-productive sometimes! You know... it reminds me of the time when big companies' websites were built using Flash, while the rest of the low-tech web had to deal with all the HTML quirks. Truth is: we almost never really write HTML, CSS or Javascript anyway these days

I think my current mission echoes what my fellow _front-end developers_ out there are trying to do, which is:

* making the Internet accessible to all
* making it simple
* making it easy to build for

### what's coming then?

This blog is an answer to the bloat of today's Internet. Many bloggers out there don't even bother with colors![*](I for one _need_ my colors, however!)

I hope there will be new trends in the web industry towards these goals:

* building simpler websites (less ads, less popups, less _garbage_, less distractions overall)
* build for a smaller ecological footprint (lower-tech server technologies? less videos/images?)
* finding an easier way to manage the content/data that's handled by the UI (decoupling it, somehow?! the right way...)
