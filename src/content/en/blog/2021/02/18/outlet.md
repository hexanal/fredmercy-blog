`6:56pm:` Turns out, I love to write. I like to read a lot, too. Ok, let me think about what I usually read, and how I find out about it...

* first thing I read all day would be the headlines in my email **newsletters** (some dev stuff, Nature Briefing, a local magazine, etc.)
    - not the articles they link to, but just to skim over and know what's up with the World.
    - I usually check out the article if it sounds very interesting and/or if I can spare some _attention_
* <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>: a bit all the time, here and there when I have an _attention credit_
* before work: the news (us, world, local; yes, in that order, weirdly)
* after work: other bloggers new articles, like:
    - <a href="https://christine.website/blog/social-media-mistake-2021-01-26" target="_blank">Christine Dodrill, ‚ÄúWas Social Media a Mistake?‚Äù</a>
    - <a href="https://macwright.com/" target="_blank">Tim McWright's blog</a>
    - <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/" target="_blank">Creative Good's blog</a>
    - these are just some I stumbled upon recently, not that I've been following for a while or anything

As you can see, it's very very *nerdy*, and I agree completely. Which is why I need to talk to other people more, and ask them about what they fucking read. It's important as fuck to understand what your friends are reading. I mean, reading a pretty private thing, mostly. You _usually_ wouldn't want to share absolutely everything you're reading, to be broadcast out there... would you? ~~Maybe you would... maybe, like people on Goodreads, or like me in this blog post! There's a user profile you infer from all this actual data...! (this is how people in advertising think)~~

In terms of books, not anything right now. I often read articles from my (very large now... damn) pile of unread Nature magazines; and when I read it, I feel simultaneously like the most intelligent person in the World and the most useless asshole the World's ever known!!! üòÑ

But the rest of the time, especially during the day: the thing I do is _write_.

I write fucking **code**, obviously üòÖ but also emails, and updates on the many services we're using for work, etc. It's a shit-ton (_shitton?_) of actual writing; so I need to make it good writing, and communicate well with my peers. At least this is how I choose to view it.

I'm communicating to other humans through all these digital means... and I never see them face-to-face, in the flesh.

I feel like I'm...

In fact I'm convinced I'm an astronaut: and when I need to leave the house I have to wear a highly protective body suit (in fact just long johns, a scarf, a winter coat, mittens, etc.), and a damn face mask!

We're floating in motherfucking space, guys. On a goddamn planet, which is a goddamn rock spinning in the empty void of the Universe, and we're all like... _fuck!_ but we need to talk to each other in real life to figure this shit out, guys. We need to put gravity back on, get back down to Earth.
