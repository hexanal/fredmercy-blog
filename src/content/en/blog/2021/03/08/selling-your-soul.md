`2:00pm:` These days I've been thinking about social media again, and about how it's just a beautiful thing. When you think about it, here's a digital tool that truly connects us all. We're able to communicate and share ideas effortlessly through space and time. We're able to form communities, join groups, make friends,

Stop.

This doesn't exist: social media these days is simply a way to give away information about ourselves to advertisers.

But I kind of want to be active on those platforms, because I, too, want to be part of the action. I want to be able to monetize my videos about this niche activity which I'm gonna do in my bedroom turned studio. Who wants to see me play the Xen levels from the original Half-Life game while high on DMT? I could do that. I kind of want to. Maybe some live coding, with tips and tricks about HTML and CSS? Something for nerds, something about <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vim</a>, maybe?

Go fuck yourselves, though. First of all, if I did something like that, I would give it **for free forever** on my website! Not for advertisers to prey on you as you watch it. And the only recommendation engine you should trust is my own personal curated recommendations; annotated with my reasons for recommending[*](unlike Big Tech's recommendation algorithms; although I've seen it being tested on YouTube? It says “Because you watched blah blah” now!).

Eventually, maybe some other content would be monetized, if the _effort_ I had to put into making it way too great to give it for free. Like a book. But then I'd have to advertise the book? No thanks. I can't do that.

`2:12pm:` Sure seems like a good time, though? Uh? That's the appeal of it, guys. Don't do it, though.

Don't sell your soul.
