`10:49am:` This blog is a weird thing. For starters, I definitely overshare; and also... I overshare to practically no one, haha! ðŸ˜…

Lately my posts have been super bleak and I sound like an angry man, bitter about life, shaking his fist at the sky, yelling at the immensity of the Cosmos, giving not even a hint of a solution, and fully expecting his torment to continue for infinity.

To change my mind while still safely oversharing, I [wrote a nostalgic post about my favorite game](/ramblings/playtime-is-now), and since it got pretty rambly, it ended up in the "ramblings" section, of course ðŸ˜›
