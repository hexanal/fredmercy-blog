`10:42am:` Still working on this website so that I feel like I have a decent _home_ on this weird network!

Lately I've been on a _degrowth_ path, embracing my _low-tech_ inclinations... it's still unclear what I'm gonna do with all of this stuff I cram in my brain, but something concrete has to be done, not just noodling around with some _web shit_ all day that's for sure.

In terms of stuff I could share with y'all, here are the news:

* 🕹 my gf bought [Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)) recently and we had a lot of fun playing it! Too bad our PS4 is on its last leg... we might not be able to finish it (maybe we'll continue the adventure on a Linux laptop or something)
* 💫 YouTube's grasp is still holding my attention hostage, and yesterday I got properly _toasted_ and watched [this Arvin Ash video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ6943_Qtyg)! It's so soothing and well-made, and packed with so much good stuff that I can't resist sharing it here. It's so deeply disturbing to me, all this science... that I ended going back to [Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts) for an even more soothing voice, and for a more _spiritual_ perspective on existence. I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6sZQOADpt0) which is really perfect if you want to simultaneously relax and learn more about the Buddhist (and others) perspective.
* 🗣 ...and because YouTube is relentlessly pushing for **highly relevant** content, I ended up watching “The Nature of Reality: A Dialogue Between a Buddhist Scholar and a Theoretical Physicist”, which is a discussion [between Alan Wallace and Sean Carroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLbSlC0Pucw)
* 🙈 it's the little _entertainement bubble_ I've created for myself to face the absurdity of the Universe head-on, while [crawling back into my comfort zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7phoVOFuKeQ) and ignore the harshness of today's _climate_ (social, political, or otherwise).

Today's entry wasn't so bad, eh? Short and sweet.

🙏 Have a great day, guys!
