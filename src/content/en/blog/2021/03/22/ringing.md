`2:48pm:` For as far back as I can remember, I've known I have mild tinnitus. And now it _sounds_ like I have it **intensely** in my right ear: it's quite distracting! Can't complain; it's not life-threatening or anything, and since I've been abusing my body for so many years with poor health habits, it's no wonder why it would start breaking down ☠️

Let's talk about COVID, though: this shit is honestly bringing me down hard, morally and psychologically. I could add physically and artistically, too, if I really loved adverbs. Seriously, you know it's gonna put a damper on our **Summer Vibe** here in Montreal, when everybody's gonna want to picnic in the city's beautiful parks, but nobody learned to surf so when we'll all stare down the barrel of that mythical _third wave_, we'd better hope it's not loaded with a live round this time ‘round!

## why even have a blog?

Even before COVID, because of arbitrary principles, I have isolated myself in a corner of the Internet, having decided to let go of traditional social media in a search for something else. So far, and currently, my search has led me back to the old `blogosphere`, which might sound really dumb to the young people of today, or even to people in the distant future reading this (if my blog survived the data transports all these years)

On it, I get to share exactly what I want, when I want. I can (and I will!) remove the ramblings section, at some point. That's something I can do. It's a semi-static place where I expose things to the "internet public". But it's a deliciously nerdy endeavour, to own and maintain a blog.

I'm a shy person. But not really. So I like this idea of a social network that grows with actual influence. To interact with the blogosphere is to link to others, in some way. Not just a click on "follow", and suddenly here comes DATA POURING IN FROM SOMEONE; although if you want that, you can subscribe to their <a href="/rss.xml" data-no-transition>RSS Feed</a>.

For now I link to no-one, which is like being on Twitter and following 0 account. Maybe someday I will!

## how's everything?

Good, man... _considering_!

## anything new on that blog?

Recently:

- a new, more "classic" header
- a new footer!
- moved the "language switcher", "comments", and "help" links to the footer
- apparently, me telling my audience of 0 people about the development I do on that blog in a developer-style _commit log_ kind of way... it's crazy, it's nerdy

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="it gets nerdier! (+)">

- I've tried implementing "multi-site" to my setup, but it became a bloated mess, which probably means I need to revisit this later, or start again from scratch now with another perspective.
- I've implemented url "aliases", which means I can fake redirects. If I change the title of this post later, I will manually add the previous name as an "aliases" in the _frontmatter_ of the content file. If I forget, or if I don't; no redirect, I might have created a broken link in someone's bookmarks.
    - also, it's cool if I want a page to have many possible URL entries: for example, this post is also available at the URL [https://fredmercy.ca/ringing-in-my-ears](/ringing-in-my-ears)
    - cool for permalinks also (note: I probably should implement a `permalink` key in the frontmatter to that effect)
