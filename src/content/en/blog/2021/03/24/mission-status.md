`10:19am:` I'd love to write about interesting things I know nothing about like history, sociology, physics, geology, etc. but I don't want to talk out of my ass, so I'll stick with the web stuff, which is the closest thing I have to an _expertise_.

-> my mission is to **make web technologies easy to understand so that more people can figure out how to build things on the web** ([click here to get started!](#learn-to-code))

Building websites isn't rocket science: in fact, it's kind of super easy, and a lot of people had blogs and personal websites back in the early ‚Äò00s. However, nowadays it's much easier (and cheaper!) to setup a Facebook page, especially if you want to display basic content in a way that's familiar to the people using the platform, who are numerous (in the _[billions](https://www.statista.com/statistics/408971/number-of-us-facebook-users/)_, actually)

Nah, I'm not talking about helping folks to build blogs here, necessarily. I'm talking about using the power of web as true expression; using it as raw material to craft a digital place. To do that, you will require skills that span a wide landscape, filled with ‚Äútechnologies‚Äù, and by technologies here I refer to stuff like: programming languages; concepts used to describe and manage networked computers; concepts used to describe and manage a _codebase_; programs used to write (and, yes, _manage_) code; and the list goes on....... but don't worry, most of it is bullshit nonsense, a consequence of the fact that we're all trying to figure it out as we go, pressured by, or motivated by, a whole lot of money being poured into this industry.

## learn to code!!

You can continue reading if at some point you will want to learn how to build websites, otherwise you can stop here, because it's gonna get boring!

Have a good one! üëã

> First off: these are just my observations and opinions about my current understanding of the web, and they're also heavily influenced with my personal aspirations and philosophies. Take everything you read with a grain of salt! <em>üßÇ</em>

So. What y'all need is to learn the basics of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). Then after that, forget about technical shit and focus on what you want to communicate with your website!

I'm joking a bit here but to be honest, if you want to have a website it doesn't have to be technically advanced. It needs to be legible, and it needs to be _focused_. Raw HTML can get you there.

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is easy to understand. It's really not much, and since it truly is the bedrock of web content, I would be **shocked** to learn the basics of HTML templating isn't taught in schools by now. Anybody that surfs the web should know basic HTML; I'm only half-kidding here.

Next: learn [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). Ahhhhh, the oft-mocked language that veterans and newbies alike love to hate on! It's true, it is a very weird and frustrating language to learn. I would compare it to... woodcarving, or something like sculpting, or something that requires hours upon hours of trial-and-error to figure it out. In this space, a lot of energy is spent from my peers to invent new ways of _styling_ HTML, by using what we call _libraries_, or _utilities_, _tools_, _helpers_, etc. These are like pre-made things that you can use to speed-up the development of your websites. They come with their own philosophies which may of may not stray far from ‚Äúthe way we've done thing traditionally‚Äù

My next quirky analogy is this: instead of having to carve raw wood, or sculpt solid marble with your own low-level tools, when using CSS tools it's like using Lego-like blocks that you arrange in cool combinations. It's cool, I personally love Legos... for playing! or maybe when prototyping?

But what about when _inventing?_

CSS is, again, the only way you can style something in a browser: it's the standard. Until some browser decides to invent their own new standard (obviously these days only Google Chrome could), we're stuck with it. [note: I wouldn't mind a new way to style the web, something more modern... but the old man in me is **really content** with the current state of CSS, and happy with just how fast new features are introduced: carefully.]

Writing CSS style sheets will help you design the web, to make it display _anything_. Obviously, some things aren't possible to display with CSS; but then again CSS was only intended to style **documents**, and certainly not meant to be used to draw anything on a canvas.

To make the web truly interactive and _alive_, you need [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Mighty JS now powers **heeaaaaaaps** of software, thanks to widely used codebases such as React and [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework))'s for example.

Javascript is the key to the browser's heart, because it's the only language that's allowed to speak to web pages (on behalf of both the _client_ and the _server_)

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="why is javascript bad?">

JS is just a weird language invented at some point by some dude while he was working for Netscape, and somehow it now powers 97% of web pages.

The future of Javascript is uncertain to me; what I know and what I feel is a need for a sturdier language that sort of becomes the new standard. But maybe I'm talking out of my ass again, or maybe it's for a more distant future.

The other languages that web developers often use instead of writing Javascript (to _avoid_ it), like, I don't know... ClojureScript, or Elm, are still compiled to Javascript to be parsed by a browser.

I almost only know Javascript right now, when "programming languages" are concerned; I know it well and I can make it do some stuff, but I am pretty certain it's not the absolute best language for enhancing web pages.

</aside>

And there you have it. Master HTML, CSS and Javascript and you will become king. These days, the thing is that Javascript seems to be able to skip over HTML and CSS altogether thanks to libraries like [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)). React is a framework that unites HTML, CSS and Javascript in a way that makes dynamic pages easier to write... but by doing so, skips over so many things that make "pure HTML & CSS" so good. [note: it was created and maintained by Facebook, so that makes it _bullshit by default_ for me, just out of principle! but the concept it brought to the table is a great one ‚úåÔ∏è]

What I call a _web page_ is the interpretation and visual representation of `.html` files, of `.css` files, and `.js` files (and a whole bunch of other files but that's not important yet) by a web browser. The web browser displays the results of some computation of all these assets; the computation is supposedly based on the _specifications_ of each of those languages I talked about. Because all of this is sometimes left open for interpretation, it means that a web page displayed in one browser probably won't match what is displayed in another: **and it's fine.**

One of the pain points of frontend web development for a long time, has been _cross-browser compatibility_... which is a nerdy way of saying _‚Äúmaking web pages feel the same in every browser‚Äù_. It's really difficult to reach a point where a website is really 100% the same on the most popular browsers. I say it's _fine_ because this concern has mostly to do with consumer-facing websites, _apps_, or _marketing_ websites, or a website that relies heavily on visual consistency: when building a website for yourself, your dog, your daughter, your business, as a way to share information about something, as a way to communicate with your friends, to organize with them, etc. You don't need it to look _exactly the same_, do you? Just follow HTML, CSS, and Javascript's **best practices**, and you should be fine.

## that can't be it...?

You're right! There's a ton more to learn from there! In no particular order, the things you need to care about are, like, _accessibility_ with ARIA attributes (?!), _favicons_ ü§î, the _DOM_ ‚ùî, _SVG_ images, _JSON_ objects, _sitemaps_, _GDPR compliant_ websites...

All of that you need to pick up as you go. Look at what pages are made of when "inspecting" in a browser (when you do `Right Click > Inspect Element`), read tutorials, watch YouTube videos on each of those. Most importantly: try shit out in HTML files to figure out for youself how the different browsers interpret your HTML, CSS and JS.

Godspeed!
