Because I'm a nerdy web-guy, I've been thinking about online privacy a lot, especially in early 2019 when I started this blog and first [wrote about degooglin'](/blog/2019/02/02/entry). Since then, our lives were forced evermore online because of _you-know-what_ (which must be excellent news to companies who profit from a lack of online privacy!), and I have been vigorously trying to plug the data leaks in my life.

Going the _total-privacy_ way is feasible, if not painful. Being tech-savvy is pretty much mandatory if you want to go this route. What's more, you might suffer from a dearth of online socialization: going total-private means you have to own and control your data, which precludes the use of products from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.

> In the above paragraph, I mixed two idea: keeping data private, and keeping data under your control. It's easier if you only decide to trust a third party to keep your data private, without having to manage where the actual data resides (you do not manage/own the server where the files are located)

The opposite is of course, going _full-public_, let it all fly away, be _wide open_. It's a concept that I'm not ashamed to admit I first reflected on after listening to an episode of Joe Rogan's podcast: what if there was absolutely zero guarantee that **anything** you do in life will remain private?

Obviously, this would suck, right? If your browsing activity is public, suddenly you won't feel safe browsing some shady websites. If your emails can be read by **anyone**, are you even inclined to use emails anymore?! What about offline, too? What if people had access to any kind of information about anybody else? What kind of society would it create?

* Going _total-privacy_ seems to indicate a willingness to disappear from searches, to be invisible, to keep one's data secret. We require _total-privacy_ for safety reasons: if somebody else had access to our information, they could use it as blackmail, or something worse.
* Going _no-privacy_ indicates a lack of care of one's possessions. It shows a disregard for property and secrecy. A person who decides to give away their right to privacy becomes a pseudo-public figure, walking naked through fire.

Why in the world would you decide to go without privacy?

Reading the intro for the [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) page on Wikipedia confirms it's... kind of a new concept. I had a hunch that technology (in the broader sense of the term, not just cellphones and laptops and shit) enabled people to claim privacy in more effective ways, with actual locks and keys, safes, encryption cyphers and whatnot.

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="technology‽ (+)">

Okay now, here's another crazy rant, a ridiculous opinion from a naive nerd and a stoner piece of shit loser:

I don't like how some people use technology, in all senses of the term. Mostly, it's fed to (or _gobbled by_) greedy-as-fuck industries, because _OF COURSE_ they have the means to invest **heavily** into this new tech, and push it forward to pursue their interests. Look, it's fine. It's totally fine if you basically figure out new magic tricks that turn your company into a bottomless money well. It's cool if you also pay the best lawyers to avoid paying taxes, it's perfect! No problem with paying your employees minimum wage, despite turning unprecedented profits year after year, with your vampire fangs firmly planted into the already frail neck of society.

If you know me personally, you know who I am: I'm Fred Mercy, some random guy, walking straight on the median-line, the most mediocre person you'll meet today. Do I value privacy? Sure I do, sometimes. When I take a shit I lock the door, you know? When I was told I needed to keep my social insurance number private, I tried to keep private.

At the same time, I'm also a negative/defeatist/pessimistic chump and I assume there's nothing I can do to keep things _total-private_ against some ass-hat black hat hacker who somehow decides to get all up in my private shit.

What can we do? Encrypt stuff _end-to-end_? Do you even understand what that means? because fuck me if I do or ever will understand, man! I can't even _begin_ to understand the algorithms involved. And when my more-informed friends throw stuff at me like “quantum computers will be able to break current encryption methods”, it echoes in my head endlessly and crystallizes into a final idea: if it's at all possible, then maybe some government program, some company, some motherfucker out there has it all figured out already, and we're already pretty much defenseless when it comes to our privacy while online.

~~

To sum up: you're either ready to nerd-up **BIG TIME** and encrypt everything that you care to keep private, or keep nothing private and assume that privacy is a concept made-up by _stupid fucking white men_.

Since 2019, I'm sluggishly walking in the _total-privacy_ direction and getting actual headaches. And mind you, I'm computer-savvy so what's a regular user to do?

Ah, there's nothing to do. The choices have been made and advertisement-backed platforms are our go-to. We want free shit and we're ready to give up a bit of privacy to get it. We're okay with being blasted with constant temptations.

Sweet. You've reached the end of this godawful blog entry, and now you realize what my problem is, and it's always the same story: not only is privacy illusory, but this fact is being **actively exploited by advertising**.

When you know someone well, you can sell them anything. But the problem is, we're already being sold TOO MUCH BULLSHIT. And not only that, but it's choking our communication channels. Can I please go about my business without having to suffer through stupid fucking ads? It's on every subway wall, in buses, trains, planes; it's in my magazines, on billboards everywhere I look; covering cars, trucks, caps, tshirts, patches, badges, keyring, postcards, and your custom KeepCup; they're in my movies, games, apps, email, mail, texts, websites, search results, videos, news, podcasts, newsletters.

Thanks for sponsoring us, ads! Without you, apparently nobody would create anything, and nobody would make money!

Not only is privacy illusory, but we also live inside a planetary Ponzi-scheme, based on tapping into this lack of privacy to sell us more _useless crap_!

> Man, I really need to lighten up, don't it?!
