`2021-04-09 @ 1:06pm:` I'm beating a quick retreat! It's a _retreat_ in every sense of the word: a) a move away from the buzzing of hi-tech bullshittery; b) a withdrawal from the battlefield of “new-ideas”; c) a process of becoming smaller (smaller ecological footprint); and d) maybe a decline of value of my own life?

Today, this retreat into low-tech seems like a way to brace myself for whatever might happens to modern technology.

We've seen that the lifespans of the even the most mainstream technologies we used to write/read/encode/decode data can be really short: we've seen magnetic tape come and go, you know... the cassettes, the floppy disks; we've seen optical storage, with CDs, minidiscs, DVDs, Blurays....

Ok, so these are just the media _substrate_ that "host" the data (music, movie, text, etc.) that we now _encode_ into digital bits. To store these bits, lately I think we're mostly using [solid-state drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive), the best technology we've found to hold data for longer periods of time.

This is best we've got?

## what does _low-tech_ mean for a web developer?

To me, working on a website feels just like building something physical; sometimes, it only needs to be built to look good and maybe it was rushed a little... which means the foundations might not have been properly setup. Or maybe no real architect oversaw the process of building the website and it ends up being a weird facade with a lot of _broken design_.

I've built many websites that were pretty much destined for the digital landfills: like building temporary accomodations, for an event, and not even thinking about when we'll have to disassemble it later.

At that point in my career, I want to build _real_ websites. A website like a monument: build to last, build to the highest standards, build from noble materials. And also: it would be built with its own **repairability** and **expandability** in mind. Something to survive _deep time_. And I imagine a website as a _user experience_ that spans generations, and never discriminates: if you can read the language used by the original author(s), you should be able to navigate the content effortlessly.

## existential risks

`2021-04-09 @ 1:20pm:` After learning about it, I spent a while thinking about [Nick Bostrom's Existential Risks](https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html), and lately I've thought about the technology stack that we depend on to survive these days. It just seems so ludicrously fragile to me, but then again it might be because no one person can truly know in details what every layer of technology is responsible for, and how it all works.

No one person could hack away in their shed and come out with a Macbook M1. It takes incredibly deep knowledge in many areas of engineering, programming, electronics, even design, etc. to achieve.

I'm not a zombie-apocalypse guy, but our web-stack we've become enamored with over the current years, while not absolutely vital for survival, has helped us communicate information super efficiently, for us to collaborate on big challenges. And these days I'm wondering how sturdy that technological stack really is?

## but why?

`2021-04-12 @ 09:24am:` To illustrate the importance of some concepts we deal with in this industry: how to build something that's easy to maintain and easy to keep up-to-date?

While it's pure overkill to think in those terms for most websites and apps, I would like to think that my job is about something more than putting up cardboard façades to _funnel users into clicking the “subscribe to our newsletter” button_. I recently tweeted about this because I got fed up with the whole “crazy animated website” trend, which seemed to me like just another shiny bait.

Lately I've been writing a lot about advertising and how it's all bad, but the truth is that... I believe in advertising. I believe in beautifully crafted _experiences_, I believe in _great products_, I believe in _touching people down to their souls with powerful messages_ (an incredible skill to have!), I believe in art that brings people closer together, I believe in a sense of community, etc. And these beliefs can flourish in a healthy advertising landscape.

* Generate wealth: yes, it's cool.
* Generate happiness: oh yeah, much better.
* Generate love: _the best!_
