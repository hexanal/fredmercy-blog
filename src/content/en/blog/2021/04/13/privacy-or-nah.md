Because I'm a nerdy web-guy, I've been thinking about online privacy a lot, especially in early 2019 when I started this blog and first [wrote about degooglin'](/blog/2019/02/02/entry). Since then, our lives were forced evermore online because of _you-know-what_ and I have been trying to plug some of my data “leaks”.

## totally private, mate

Going the _total-privacy_ way is doable but it's a pain. You have to know about computers if you want to go this route. What's more, you might suffer from a dearth of online socialization: going total-private means you have to own and control your data, which precludes the use of products from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.

Already, I mixed two idea: keeping data private, and keeping data under your control. Most people entrust a third party (e.g. Google) to keep their data private, that way you don't have to manage where your data is physically stored. That's the _cloud_. The problem is that if this third party taps into your data in order to show you personalized ads, it's not really private anymore, is it? It's been looked at, and used! ...and, okay, it was probably only seen by a program, not a human, but I argue with this post that you simply can't trust _anyone_ with your data.

> Going _total-privacy_ seems to indicate a willingness to disappear from searches, to be invisible, to keep one's data secret. We require _total-privacy_ for safety reasons: if somebody else had access to our information, they could use it as blackmail, or something even worse!

## totally public, dude

The opposite is of course, going _full-public_, let it all fly away, be _wide open_: instead of data being private by default, you consider it public domain as soon it touches the network.

Obviously this sucks, right? If your browsing activity is public, can you feel safe browsing some websites? If any private information you give to a third-party (e-commerce website, forum, etc.) can potentially [leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach) out and become public; you might as well consider it public to begin with.

Reading the intro for the [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) page on Wikipedia confirms it's... kind of a new concept. "Modern" technology has helped people keep things private in more effective ways, with actual locks and keys, safes, laws on private property, encryption and whatnot.

I value privacy just like any other person. At the same time, I'm also a negative/defeatist/pessimistic chump and I assume there's nothing I can do to keep things _total-private_ against some ass-hat black hat hacker who somehow decides to get all up in my private business!

What can I do? Encrypt stuff _end-to-end_? I don't really know what it means, and I can't even _begin_ to understand the algorithms involved. And when my more-informed friends share stuff like “quantum computers will be able to break current encryption methods”, it echoes in my head endlessly: if it's at all possible, then maybe some government program, some company, some hacker out there has it all figured out already, and keeping our digital belongings private is already futile.

> Going _no-privacy_ indicates a lack of care of one's possessions. It shows a disregard for property and secrecy. A person who decides to give away their right to privacy becomes a pseudo-public figure, walking naked through fire, their data leaking out continuously, spilling all over the network's [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons).

## conclusion

To sum up: you're either ready to nerd-up **BIG TIME** and encrypt everything that you care to keep private, or keep nothing private and assume that privacy is a concept made-up by _white men_.

Since 2019, I have been sluggishly walking in the _total-privacy_ direction and getting actual headaches.

Sweet.

You've reached the end of this godawful blog entry, and now you realize what my problem is, and it's always the same story: not only is privacy illusory, but this fact is being **actively exploited by advertising**.

When you know someone well, you can sell them anything. But the problem is, we're already being sold TOO MUCH BULLSHIT. And not only that, but it's choking our communication channels. Can I please go about my business without having to suffer through stupid fucking ads? It's on every subway wall, in buses, trains, planes; it's in my magazines, on billboards everywhere I look; covering cars, trucks, caps, tshirts, patches, badges, keyring, postcards, and your custom KeepCup; they're in my movies, games, apps, email, mail, texts, websites, search results, videos, news, podcasts, newsletters.

Thanks for sponsoring us, ads! Without you, apparently nobody would create anything, and nobody would make money!

Not only is privacy illusory, but we also live inside a planetary Ponzi-scheme, based on tapping into this lack of privacy to sell us more _useless crap_!
