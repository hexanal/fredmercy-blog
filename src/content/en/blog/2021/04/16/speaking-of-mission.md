`2:09pm:` In an entry from this winter, I wrote that it felt like I lived “on another planet”: when days were cold, and the crisis got even more severe in my region, and leaving the house was like going on a spacewalk. 👨‍🚀

In my information-bubble, my _nerdosphere_, there is something going on... some sort of trend, which I'm approaching slowly but around which I'm not in orbit yet: [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)

What is it? It's exactly what I've been looking for. It's a stripped-down web, a protocol that focuses on serving bare-minimum documents. It's named after a space mission, and borrows a lot of lingo from that era, too (“capsule”, “CAPCOM”, “Spacewalk”, ...) 🛰

I love it already!

## why?

With this personal website, in the beginning, my goal was to use it to showcase my _web-developer_ skills but... _*ahem*_, lately I've only been removing features, because what's ultimately more important to me is **its contents**.

There will come a time for more design-oriented and interactive projects, and those will be hosted alongside this website's pages. But obviously the nature of their content will be different: my web design work is more artistic and abstract, more ephemeral, and based on a hodgepodge of technologies; while my writing is purer, just a bunch of utf-8 characters in plain text files.

Okay, so Gemini is perfect for me because then I can forget about _styling_ anything and just focus on writing stuff. When browsing Gemini, the client takes care of the formatting!

It checks many boxes:

* minimalist
* _nerdy_
* deliciously low-tech
* and it's new to me, so it's interesting

## what's next?

I'm thinking of having some build-step that outputs my blog as a Gemini-ready site.
