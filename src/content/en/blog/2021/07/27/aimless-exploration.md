`7:38pm:` I've spent most of this year thinking about a *real thing* I could
produce, in the hope of tackling new web development challenges:

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="view ideas (+)">

- a website to visually show/explain the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) to explore atoms and electrons and shit
- a website to create photo albums that could then be shared to family and friends behind passwords/account
- something that might act as a content management system for this very blog
- a local-network accessible interface that would be used by our household to control shit like lights, screens, whatever...
- etc.

</aside>

## what now?!

the thing is: all of that stuff requires a ton of time to invest in the *backend* infrastructure, and... I simply don't have the time nor the energy.

what I want is to do some frontend work; but I don't have any excuse to start hacking at some `<div>`'s and slapping some cool CSS on 'em.

## cool

so here's what I'm gonna try to do instead:

* pages on this website / for frontend (and ux?) explorations / about random shit
* the way I want to do it / it could get weird / i just want to have some fun / perhaps discover stuff
* I **DON'T** want to:
    * spend forever installing bullshit frameworks, a CMS, databases
    * no!
    * never
