`1:14pm:` I've added some rounded corners everywhere... just because I think it looks *friendlier*. That's really a microscopic design evolution. I was wondering if I should embark on a redesign, but _“probably not”_ is the answer that comes naturally: what I've got now isn't bad and I should focus my energy on more interesting things instead.

Other than that: days go by, life is sweet, and I'm still trying not to go too crazy.

## life

Summer is such a trip, man. Days are long and steamy and it feels like we're in the jungle. I've always been vaguely interested in plants, trees, flowers, etc. but seeing them thrive in this climate makes me appreciate this miraculous kingdom.

I've got my own little bean that's sprouting and growing taller every day, and another one on the way! That's cool.

Summer means I've been taking it slow; super lazy. Sometimes it's cool to disconnect a little from the churn, to step aside for the gaping maw of **attention-eating devices** (yes, I'm still complaining about the toxicity of social media and today's communication channels in general, yay!)

Anyway -> time to go live with this post!
