    notes:
      - As a science enthusiast, it took me a long time before diving head-first into Star Trek!

    rating: 3, adequate
    notes:
      - I've been using this for a while now to replace Google Drive, and Google Calendar
      - It works sufficiently well that I'm not too bothered by any lack of feature (in fact, there's such a big “app” ecosystem that there's surely an app for your needs)
      - The UI still sucks, though, which is why I rate it so low. :)
      - It'll get better, just wait
