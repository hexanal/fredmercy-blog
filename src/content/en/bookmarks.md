    title: 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'
    source: imdb.com
    link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/reference
    notes:
      - As a science enthusiast, it took me a long time before diving head-first into Star Trek!
      - I was not disappointed by the constant quality of show, the weirdness of it all, the old-schoolness of it (the ’90s!), the humanism of it all
    rating: 5, the best!

    notes:
      - This game absolutely gave me PTSD! Not to joke about this condition, though... the graphic violence and tortured characters often made me feel really bad for the people living in this world.
    rating: 5, very good!
