- `music` [Celebrating 25 Years of Legendary Electronic Label Planet Mu (bandcamp.com)](https://daily.bandcamp.com/label-profile/planet-mu-25th-anniversary-guide)
  - I loved that label when I was a teen... still do!

- `nerd` [Electronic Frontier Foundation's Privacy page](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy)
  - if you need to learn more about privacy on the Internet

- `tv` [Star Trek: The Next Generation (imdb.com)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/reference)
  - As a science enthusiast, it took me a long time before diving head-first into Star Trek!
  - I was not disappointed by the constant quality of show, the weirdness of it all, the old-schoolness of it (the ’90s!), the humanism of it all
  - Bookmark added from [“Gonna change again”](/blog/2020/11/17/gonna-change-again)
  - Rating: ★★★★★ _the best!_

- `gaming` [The Last Of Us: Part II (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II)
  - This game absolutely gave me PTSD! Not to joke about this condition, though... the graphic violence and tortured characters often made me feel really bad for the people living in this world.
  - Rating: ★★★★☆ _very good!_

- `nerd` [JuliaMono (official website)](https://juliamono.netlify.app)
  - I'm currently using this font: it's clean, it's legible, it has the right amount of ligatures, etc.

- `philosophy` [Wikipedia article for the Slow Movement](https://www.slowmovement.com/)
  - A philosphy about taking things slow, dude...!

- `philosophy` [Dérive ("drifting"; wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive)
  - Take a walk through your city, without a destination in mind; let your mind wander, let your body follow, roam around this (urban?) landscape and discover new things

- `tv` [The Midnight Gospel (IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11639414/reference)
  - A trippy Netflix series based on recordings from Duncan Trussell's podcast, with awesome animations!
  - Rating: ★★★★☆ _yummy!_

- `movie` [_The Neon Demon_ (IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1974419)
