## news

`march 24, 2022` / `9:08pm`

Quick update to the old website...! *pfew*

Quick word about my situation for those who might be interested: 

> I'm back! I'm alive.
> Winter's got me pinned down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
> But springtime is upon us, and there is hope yet.
> When I'm not battling depression, life's keeping me quite busy.

I have not much else to share for now.

I'm back on Instagram over at [instagram.com/fredmercy.ca](https://instagram.com/fredmercy.ca). I needed a place to share dumb pictures. And maybe reconnect with old friends.

Stay safe out there.
