`december 25, 2021` / `12:21pm`

I wish you all a **Merry Christmas and Happy New Year**!

This year was a special one again, for many reasons, so I hope you had the chance to meet with friends and family, and had a good time.

Keep your head up high, stay safe, and have fun. I love you all!

Bye for now.
