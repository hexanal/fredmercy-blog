## welcome!

This is my personal website!

I originally created it to showcase my work as a web person, but I also use it to share stuff, and talk about anything. I just like to **create** stuff; lately it's been **mostly websites** 😄

Right now, I'm working on a few personal projects while enjoying life in beautiful <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/45.5386/-73.6174&layers=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Montréal</a>.

> If you're looking for a frontend developer, I'm currently available for freelance work. You can check out my [resume](/resume).
