Hey! Hope you're doing fine today. Personally, I'm fighting a mother~~fuck~~er of a cold which I **can't wait** to *K.O.*

After that, homie's gotta take a break, you know? Take a little breather, relax, *recuperate*.

Other:

* I updated the [links](/links) page with more bull~~shit~~.
* Added new themes:
  * <a href="#theme-nova" data-component="emit" data-event="SET_THEME" data-event-payload="nova" data-transition="none">nova</a> & <a href="#theme-hypernova" data-component="emit" data-event="SET_THEME" data-event-payload="hypernova" data-transition="none">hypernova</a>, its dark version
  * <a href="#theme-dim" data-component="emit" data-event="SET_THEME" data-event-payload="dim" data-transition="none">Dim</a>, not an [*accessible*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_accessibility) theme, but one to use while reading in *very low light* maybe!

Quick update to the old website...! *pfew*

Quick word about my situation for those who might be interested: 

> I'm back! I'm alive.
> Winter's got me pinned down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
> But springtime is upon us, and there is hope yet.
> When I'm not battling depression, life's keeping me quite busy.

I have not much else to share for now.

I'm back on Instagram over at [instagram.com/fredmercy.ca](https://instagram.com/fredmercy.ca). I needed a place to share dumb pictures. And maybe reconnect with old friends.

Stay safe out there.
