## the live blog way

`november 8, 2021` / `7:34pm`

Gotta cook dinner tonight.

I'm also thinking about a bunch of work-related stuff, which is maybe stuff I could be sharing on there... which would give this “live-blog” concept become more real, as I refine the tools I use to make this very website work.

Right now I'm thinking about all the tooling around the problem of “ease-of-creation” of new page template. By that, I mean how easy it is to *create a new page (a new route/url) on my website*. Ideally, it would be so easy that even someone untrained would be able to create a new page on this website, and make it their own. Of course, within limits thought-up by the developers. But this is where I'm tying the whole developer-experience thing with it: by making the whole API focus on the *creating new pages* problem, I would make it accessible to untrained but *tech-savvy* people the power to fully tweak a website.

Truth is: I want to make my job easier, to be able to focus on the stuff I should be focusing on, like animations, dealing with media like audio, video playback, etc. That's probably what i should be focusing on. :)

I'm also interested in design, and UX. But it's also all about conveying information as *beautifully* as possible. I'm taking the Steve Jobs route and I want to inject design principles in the programming world. Beautiful design makes sense: it helps, it's human-centric. See also: accessibility. I care about that shit.
