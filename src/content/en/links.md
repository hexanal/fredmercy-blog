title: Links and stuff
description: A place where I dump links to the things I've been into lately. It's basically a hodge-podge of “sorta” related links, quotes, snippets, bits and pieces I've gleaned from the internet. It's also a place where I get loose and philosophize and bit, you know?

## things I'm into lately

1. not reading the news no mo'!
    - because of the abursdity of today's societal _vibe_
    - it's bringing me down
2. [MARCH2022](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0HtaHoUbcORjumElFJK8ul?si=4c1664f09bd54320)
    - this month's personal playlist *(uncurated recent discoveries)*
    - still oscillating between hip-hop and psych
3. [Deep Ecology](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Deep_ecology)
    - still sorta touched by this philosophy...
4. [SSRI pills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)
    - hopefully they'll work their magic
