title: Links and stuff
description: A place where I dump links to the things I've been into lately. It's basically a hodge-podge of “sorta” related links, quotes, snippets, bits and pieces I've gleaned from the internet. It's also a place where I get loose and philosophize and bit, you know?

### blabbering

* Lately I've been commuting/driving to & from the clinic so many times... That's what kids'll do to you!
* I'm very fortunate not to have to drive everywhere I need to go; I'm grateful because driving in the city and owning a car kind of *sucks*, I think.
