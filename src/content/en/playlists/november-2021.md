`NOVEMBER2021` -> goto [`OCTOBER2021`](/playlists/october-2021)

It begins with a song I found via Spotify's Afrobeats Essentials, then onto a very kraftwerkian song by Mildlife that's long and trippy and meditative and krauty. Then L'éclair, with P+R... a weirdo of a song that takes me somewhere every time I listen to it especially because of that old-scifi sounding FM synth part... ugh!

Then it's another trip out of a song by Ulrich Schnauss, a new release (when a friend of mine told me about the guy I played “Between Us and Them” on repeat at some point! so good) straight from Spotify's New Releases auto-playlists.

Then more afrobeats.
