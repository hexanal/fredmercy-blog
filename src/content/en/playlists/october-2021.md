## October 2021

October playlists are always fun. This time around, it's again **very very eclectic**; some of those I found through Bandcamp, and most others are from Spotify recommendations, because I like to be spoon fed my entertainment. Trust the algorithm. Let go completely.

Anyway. Have a listen, or don't, I won't be mad.

I've been dumping my monthly finds in Spotify playlist for a while now, starting in December 2014. An esteemed colleague of mine suggested a few songs that ended up on it, that was cool. I'm glad I kept it going all those years. Music literally keeps me going.

Also, the last song on the playlist, “I Don't Live Here Anymore” by _The War on Drugs_ is a throwback to my `FEBRUARY2015` playlist, which includes another of their songs: _Under The Pressure_. Check it out!
