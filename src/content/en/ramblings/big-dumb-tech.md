## hey, what's wrong?!

* the **tech industry** is definitely something we're gonna have to muzzle at some point
* so-called _entrepreneurs_ hire armies of highly specialized people to QUICKLY build tech platforms
  * it's a new frontier, with a _gotta get there first!_ mentality
  * it's a no-holds-barred race towards market domination
  * it's also about finding and building new ways of **injecting advertisements** into the lives of the common people
* we're a bunch **headless chickens** running around in all directions; we're like the [infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) in action:
  * are we building towards a better, more cohesive, inclusive, healthy and sane **future**?!
  * or: are we building a mountain of single-use tech tools, destined to rot in digital landfills?

Are we building tech to get rich, dominate the market, extract wealth from the masses never giving it back, living a life of luxury _today_ at the expense of tomorrow's new generations of humans?

or: are we building technology to genuinely help our civilization survive in this cold, mysterious, impossibly-big, wonderful Universe? Why are we **still lured by greed** and **corrupted by power**?

## our chicken heads are in the cloud

* we're slaves to [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech), our heads in a fog, we're tube-fed
* instead of having to build well-made products to keep customers happy, we can just have it be **subscription-based**, and **in the cloud**, with a **free tier** so that anybody can use it; you just have to suffer the ads
  - and it's not only the usual suspects, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
  - Take for instance... Spotify! A service which, since I started using it, has been _removing_ more features than adding them while seemingly never improving on the features which stuck around!
  - Adobe Creative Suite?! It just sucks.
  - most cloud-based services give me the _heebie-jeebies_, anyway
  - don't get me fucking started on [recommendation engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), usually inseparable from (or synonymous with) advertisement down the line
    - selling me more made-in-china shit I don't and _shouldn't_ need!

## not all bad

Obviously, it's not all bad. There's the [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community, for instance!

‚Äî What is it?

In short: a Free, Libre & Open Source Software is a program for which you have access to the source code, and you can modify it _freely_ (as in ‚Äúyou have the _liberty_ to...‚Äù) and redistribute it on the same terms, if you wish.

‚Äî Sounds good... but it also sounds su<span style="font-size: 0.9rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.7rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.7rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.7rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">u</span><span style="font-size: 0.9rem;">u</span>uper **nerdy**!

‚Äî Yeah, _oops_! that's a problem! How are _normal folks_ supposed to free themselves from the grips of Big Tech?

Big Tech is always hunting for new leads... but it's not exactly a safari hunt: it's more like they're fishing using [bottom trawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_trawling)[note: which seems a fitting comparison, considering there's a section on ‚ÄúLack of regulation‚Äù üí©]. They want to reach _everybody_; they want to corner the market, they want it all.

People who aren't tech-inclined get lured in and will never hear of the alternatives. My uncle will probably never use FLOSS. My mom uses an iPad and probably already installed so many dumb apps on it that her data is now leaking out into the network, ready to inform some AI on her profile in order to show her ads with a better **conversion rate**. Almost all of my friends are still on Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp; and probably dozens of other predatory services.

We're giving away our **privacy**, **data-ownership**, **freedom**... for _convenience_. Big Tech built their own web and trapped everybody in there, and they're letting anyone feed on our data _for a fee_!

## so what? we know that shit already

I'm not a genius. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm just parrotting what I read in Hacker News again.

Or maybe something really needs to be done?
