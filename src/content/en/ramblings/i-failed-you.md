`February 23, 11:21am:` Hey! It's me again, with another dose of absurd yammering!

## we're gonna need bigger antennae!

Do you remember when you could turn on the TV, and a **live** video stream would start almost immediately, and you could leave it on for hours and it would never falter? It would stay on, like a fucking lightbulb, like a _reliable piece of technology_. Now think about how **damn near impossible** it would be nowadays to replicate the same experience with laptops, tablets, phones, etc. It's just not the same at all, eh? It's clunky, it's slow, it's riddled with ads[note: Oh my **GOD**! SO MANY _DAMN_ ADS!); and it doesn't provide the comforting simplicity dedicated hardware offered only a few years ago.

I wrote earlier about how the virtualization (i.e. ‚Äúsoftwarization‚Äù) of everything is a minuscule step towards a fully simulated environment. Most physical devices could be replaced by their virtual counterparts, projected by some hypothetical futuristic apparatus. From where I'm standing, this all-in-one device would better have to be incredibly reliable for me to accept it in my life! Would you use such a device, seeing as how most of the modern devices are barely usable as it is?[note: I'm being really harsh but it's kind of the point of this ‚Äúessay‚Äù üòÑ )

## what's failing?

Originally, I named this essay ‚ÄúWe Failed You‚Äù, and the _We_ was designating every engineer, developer, programmer, or _tech_ person in existence, of which I think I'm a part. Why did I ‚Äúfail‚Äù you? Because, according to me at least, the promise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology</a> should be to improve people's lives, make them happier, allow them to feel loved, and sadly I don't believe it achieved these (admittedly lofty) goals, and so far I don't believe I created and used technology as a way to achieve them.

We can argue day and night about whether I'm right to accuse every tech industry worker to have **failed** the rest of us. Obviously there is a degree to which it fails: technology doesn't fail us _miserably_, it doesn't fail us _constantly_, and it doesn't fail us _entirely_.

But because I work in that field (or close to it at least), I can see some of the shortcomings of **software**. Software development is an abomination. It's _beyond fucked_!

<aside data-component="drawer" data-label="tell me more about this! (+)">

The only thing I want is for software technology to mature for a bit, and reflect on how far-reaching the implications of good/bad software truly are, as we are discovering together as a society. A society that currently **has few other options other than going with whatever software we're offered in order to communicate**.

And our communication substrate is built on bullshit.

</aside>

For sure I will admit that, thanks to the progress made in hardware and software, possibilities are seemingly endless. And in fact, this is what makes me mad: the possiblities are endless but somehow we only end up with giant companies, grabbing everything, gobbling up everybody, and hijacking our conversations and our precious _attention_, greedily seeking profits at all cost. It's a barrage of new services, of subscription-based apps with siloed databases, and too often it's fucking spyware hidden in plain sight. üëÄ

Again, I'm not being super fair. Possibilities *are* being explored. Better things are currently under developement, and I want to be part of the people who develop them. I want more _regular people_ to get interested in at least the basics of what this whole mess is about.

We need to give power back to the people. Yet putting the keys to the castle in the villagers' hands isn't really helpful. Let's use that castle analogy to denote a website, or a ‚Äúplatform‚Äù. First: (a) we don't need a fucking **castle** üè∞. We need houses and places where we can gather and have private conversations, by that I mean _smaller_ websites[note: a website that doesn't try to be everything, do everything, gather everyone, entertain, torture, confine everyone into serfdom, etc.]; (b) most people won't even know what the heck to do with the keys, let alone know how to manage this castle; (c) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdOMLEJbhbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this castle is in unacceptable condition</a> üçã (d) for most folks, maybe this castle was built in another country or even on another continent!

As our digital technology improves and building things with it becomes second-nature for a growing number of people, we might see the creation of more "local" digital places. I think this is aligned with the whole "decentralization" trend that's emerging right now.

What I'm looking forward to:

1. a real inter-personal network; to bring back the organic way of forming connections online
2. if we want to use this "internet" thing, maybe we should take it more seriously
3. educate people a little more on "real-life" things, like how not to get scammed by fraudulent websites, what really happens to your data when you subscribe to an online service, and more generally: how to protect yourself from bad actors while you're plugged into this **compromised network**

Thanks for reading!
