title: Playtime is... now!
description: a love letter to the game Deus Ex
---

Like most of my peers, I have played my fair share of videogames over the years! One of my all-time favorite games is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deus Ex</a>. I must have been 13 when it came out. I think it was one of the first games I'd been anticipating, so I read everything I could about it prior to its release in 2000.

With this post, I hope to convince you to give it a try!

You have to realize... it's a _classic_ game and it didn't exactly age well graphics-wise but what's important is the story! The thing is, back when I first played it I didn't understand English that well; I'd never played any RPG yet; I didn't know much about the United States[note: other than what movies portrayed, that is! although I've seen my fair share of movies as well... man, I've seen a lot of goddamn movies!]; and at school I wasn't particularly interested in history or politics; I didn't particularly like to read much... which are all facts that could have made impossible for me to enjoy the game!

If you don't know _anything_ about Deus Ex, let me tell you why it was a difficult game to get into: this game has hours of dialogue, there are books lying around everywhere that you can read, computer emails, notes, whatever, and you end up in various locations in the United States and the rest of the World, each with their own political climate... holy shit guys, I was blasted with so much information that my head's still spinning to this day!

And I loved it.

In the past few years I haven't played that many games, but I definitely want to get back into it. I've played through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> prequel they were developing at Eidos Montreal[note: released the year after I immigrated to Canada; I even visited their office back then] and I enjoyed it a lot! Recently, I downloaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Mankind_Divided" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mankind Divided</a> on Steam and honestly I can't wait to play it.

There's a saying on the Internet: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/riff-raff/topics/54513-every-time-you-mention-deus-ex-someone-will-reinstall-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúEvery time you mention Deus Ex someone will reinstall it‚Äù</a>

I've been a victim of this many times, haha! It's this kind of piece of art that keeps on giving: it's infinitely replayable because it is timeless.

The first Deus Ex will forever hold a special place in my heart because of the many memories it brings up üñ§

What really makes this game **incredible** to me is how it kept blowing my mind as I got older and learned more things about the real world, things that I could now relate to the game; it blew my mind over and over again, as I played it and chose different ways to complete the missions[note: it was one of the first games that gave players a real sense of ‚Äúchoice‚Äù; for example you could kill a character in cold blood or leave them be, and it would affect what happens later in the game]. It taught me a good deal of English, taught me to think more deeply and critically about things, confronted me to the thorny issues surrounding the ethics of A.I. and surveillance, showed me what happens when a pandemic forces the World deeper into terror, and it was my first time walking through the streets of Paris under martial law and during the curfew!...

Well. Let's just say reality is stranger than fiction, guys!
