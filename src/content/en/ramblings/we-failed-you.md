`February 23, 11:21am:` Hey! It's me again, with another dose of absurd yammering!

## we're gonna need bigger antennae!

Do you remember when you could turn on the TV, and a **live video stream** would start almost immediately, and you could leave it on for hours and it would never falter? It would stay on, like a fucking  lightbulb, like a _reliable piece of technology_. Now think about how **damn near impossible** it would be nowadays to replicate the same experience with laptops, tablets, phones, etc. It's just not the same at all, eh? It's clunky, it's slow, it's riddled with ads[*](Oh my **GOD**! SO MANY _DAMN_ ADS!); it doesn't offer the simplicity of a dedicated device.

I wrote earlier about how the virtualization of everything is a minuscule step towards a fully simulated environment. Your physical devices could all be “simulated”, or “virtualized”, by another hypothetical device. From where I'm standing, this all-in-one device would better have to be incredibly reliable for me to accept it in my life! Would you use such a device, seeing as how most of the modern devices are barely usable? (I'm being really harsh but it's the point of this “essay”)

## what's failing?

The title of this rant is “We Failed You”. Who is “We” here? It's every software-engineer/developer/programmer/tech person in existence, of which I think I'm a part. Why did we “fail” you? Because, according to me at least, the promise of [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) should be to improve people's lives, make them happier, allow them to feel loved. And I don't believe they kept this promise.

We can argue day and night about whether I'm right to accuse every tech industry worker to have **failed** the rest of us. Obviously there is a degree to which we fail: technology doesn't fail us _miserably_, it doesn't fail us _constantly_, and it doesn't fail us _entirely_.

Because I work in that field, I can see the shortcomings of software. Software development looks like an abomination. It seems **beyond fucked**!

<aside data-component="drawer">

Ok... I write this in some weird fever, with negatively-charged emotions bubbling on the surface of my mind... it might not be the most relevant, the most balanced, the most reasonable way of expressing oneself. But this website is a representation of this constant struggle with emotions.

I'm a human being. I'm not some troll on a forum. Not just a software engineer. I'm a modern-day construction worker, who has to build stuff for a living but never has a say into _what_ I'm building.

The only thing I want is for software technology to mature for a bit, and reflect on how far-reaching the implications of good/bad software truly are, as we are discovering together as a society. A society that currently has few other options other than going with whatever software we're offered in order to communicate.

Our communication substrate is made of bullshit.
