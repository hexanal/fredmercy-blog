## what's this?

random stuff I'm into lately:

### nerdness

* still thinking about that concept of permacomputing, of software minimalism and what it means to me and to the world... or whatever
* trying to learn a little more about unix and the whole philosohpy behind it, and how it could turn me into a better software programmer (btw I'm not *really* a software programmer...)

### philosophy

* the abursdity of today's societal "feel"... or dare I say _"vibe"_?
