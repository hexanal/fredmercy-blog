## what's this?

random stuff I'm into lately:

### my monthly playlists

I've been doing playlists every month since 2015, here are pages describing each playlist in more detail along with its embedded Spotify player.

- [JANUARY2022](/playlists/january-2022)
- [DECEMBER2021](/playlists/december-2021)
- [NOVEMBER2021](/playlists/november-2021)
- [OCTOBER2021](/playlists/october-2021)

Eventually, I want to distill those playlists into a definitive list of albums to *save*. And finally break free of Spotify's stranglehold on my music listening experience.

### nerdness

* still thinking about that concept of permacomputing, of software minimalism and what it means to me and to the world... or whatever
* trying to learn a little more about unix and the whole philosohpy behind it, and how it could turn me into a better software programmer (btw I'm not *really* a software programmer...)

### philosophy

* the abursdity of today's societal "feel"... or dare I say _"vibe"_?
