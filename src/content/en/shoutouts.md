## what's this?

The “Shout-outs” page is a place where I dump links to the things I've been into lately. It's basically a hodge-podge of “sorta” related links, quotes, snippets, bits and pieces I've gleaned from the internet.

### my monthly playlists

I've been doing playlists every month on Spotify since 2015, here are pages describing each playlist in more detail along with an embedded player.

- [NOVEMBER2021](/playlists/november-2021)
- [OCTOBER2021](/playlists/october-2021)

### nerdness

* Recently stumbled upon [Organism.earth's Library](https://www.organism.earth/library/), from where I watch all of [Terence McKenna's talks.](https://www.organism.earth/library/author/terence-mckenna)
  - as a middle-class cisgender white male in the advertising (tech) industry, and a fan of rock'n'roll music, skateboard, surf, etc. I've been confronted to the “psychedelic” culture for a while now.
  - in the 1990s, Terence McKenna gave a bunch of lectures about a wide range of subjects, especially about tripping on psychedelic drugs and the effects of tripping on the minds of human beings, and how it could change our shared perspective on “what is life about”

* [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) (github.com)
  - The font I use for this website and for everything I code/write/script in

### philosophy

* [Panpsychism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Panpsychism) (via Wikiwand)
  - I know some dude was recently on Joe Rogan peddling that shit... but I've been interested in this idea for a long while now, which sounds to me like it sort of explains why we'd feel “conscious” in a very indifferent cosmos. But obviously we're *far* from being able to confirm that shit. It's fun to think about, though.

* [Deep Ecology](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Deep_ecology) (via Wikiwand)
  - If I understand this concept correctly, it sounds like it makes sense. It's a philosophy to live by, especially in this day and age. It will be tough, but I think we will all progressively wake up to the ecological crisis and change our ways. Right?
