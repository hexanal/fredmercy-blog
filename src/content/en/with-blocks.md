Hello this is some content. And then a block:[block](
component: blocks/side-note
content: "This is some content in there"
)

Something in between? This is still markdown all the way.

> quick quote before a "content" block:

[block](
component: components/content
content: |
  <h1>Hey this is some HTML</h1>
  <p>Here's a paragraph?</p>
)

Oh yeah.
