`1:16pm:` Installed myself a nice Nextcloud. Trying to pry Google's fingers off my data! âœŠ

Also trying not to use the Gmail app on my... Android phone. Whatever.

Today's music picks (very folky today):

- [Bill MacKay, _Pre-California_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxMq8wu7nmg)
- [Steve Gunn, _Ancient Jules_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W79x_WuvQ5Y)
- [William Tyler, _Alpine Star_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDuSevWPnCA)
- [Leah Senior, _Graves_ (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R30wogqnhU)

Trying to get into [The Good Place (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/) also; been a long time since I watched a show.

Take care.

`8:13pm` Y'all won't see that, but I'm hard at work trying out a lot of different colorschemes for this weblog. It's weirdly fun.
