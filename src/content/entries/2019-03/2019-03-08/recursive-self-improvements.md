`9:08am:` Spending some time trying new things for this blog: new colorscheme, new icons, and maybe something different with the archive section. I'm not even sure I need one: I could stick **all** of the entries on the homepage, and have an anchor system to jump to each month, with like a dropdown or something?! That's something to explore.

As for the blog's colors, at first I wanted to make it a little bit warmer, a little different, you know? but coming back to that almost pure blue looks way cooler. It's a bit cheeky geeky, but I like it and I guess it fits a little better.

`3:35pm:` Went ahead and deleted the archives section, as I mentioned above. It's possible that this page ends up being incredibly long if I maintain the current posting schedule, but I think at this point it makes more sense. I kind of like the little dropdown I implemented as well (although I found that styling dropdowns in Firefox isn't _awesome_, because it half-applies the styles to the dropdown options as well, and it became an ugly mess: instead I chose to have the dropdown styles be very minimal).

`3:39pm:` If you never used to do something (so it's not _in your character_) but then you start teaching yourself to do it more often (or everyday), does it become second nature? is your personality changed? can people change? is it just _difficult_ to change, so people usually don't bother trying?

Anyway, today's links shoutouts:

- [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/): a very powerful yet minimal todo list application. Basic version is free and powerful enough! I use that thing every day, it's great.
