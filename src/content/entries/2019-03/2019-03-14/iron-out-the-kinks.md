`1:10pm:` Currently recuperating from what felt like a full day of dealing with administrative bullshit<sup data-note="I know I said this was a self-censored, curseword-free blog in an earlier post, but fuck that" data-more="... I mean, this blog is supposed to be about free expression, free speech, a place where I can write whatever I want; and self-censorship is sort of a slap in the face of free speech, in my opinion.">[1]</sup> yesterday, chasing after information and fixing other people's mistakes. So I need to rest a little...

`1:40pm:` Gonna be a nice afternoon full of reading.

`2:35pm:` Also I should mention it, I guess... [King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard (Bandcamp)](http://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com) will release their next album on April 26th, entitled [Fishing For Fishies (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beIDKFwXam0)

Just wanted to talk about it because their music has rapidly become another of my addictions: they've followed me around while I was living in Australia, almost releasing a album every two month in 2017, keeping their fans stocked up on great tunes!

`3:27pm:` I've added support for some stupid small notes/references, so if you see things like [1], [2], you can click them and get a little bit more info. You can also simply hover them and a tooltip will reveal the content (but sometimes there's _more_!)
