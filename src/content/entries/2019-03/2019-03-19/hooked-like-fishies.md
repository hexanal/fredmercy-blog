`1:49pm:` I'm gonna try and get a _githook_ to update my blog automatically whenever I push code to my repository. Somehow I never took the time to figure this out before, but if I can manage to make it work, that'd be pretty sweet! Wish me luck!

`1:56pm:` Ok, first test failed, but whatever. I'll try something else.

`2:14pm:` I mean... still nothing, but maybe soon.

`2:22pm:` And to think I skipped lunch for _this?!_ Haha, just kidding, this is important and I will make it work.

`2:56pm:` I think I fundamentally misunderstood the concept of the _githooks_ and it won't be possible to implement exactly what I had in mind. That's a bummer, man. I guess I'll continue to ssh into the server and manually pull & build the blog. Like a _chump_.
