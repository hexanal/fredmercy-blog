`5:11pm:` After all this time wondering what to do with my life; how, why, when to start work; where, with whom to collaborate, etc. I finally settled and it feels good. Although it's sort of a special kind of work situation, I think it perfectly suits my needs, so I think I can rest easy on that one.

That should provide some stuff to throw brainpower at, keep me busy, as well as provide peace of mind so that I can use some leftover time to truly abandon myself into the art, into the music, which will help my current objective<sup title="which is to compose/write/perform/record an EP in the upcoming months!">[1]</sup>.

`5:16pm:` I quite enjoy the looks of that blog now, good colors, okay layout. But I'm not in love with the way I'm updating the content. It's a bit of a pain... I sure wish I had an online interface where I could just drop my content and have the blog update itself, or something. But, whatever, for now I think it's very manageable, if not practical.
