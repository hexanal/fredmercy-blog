`5:55pm:` I was just thinking “man, I sure eat like a complete slob these days” while wolfing down a ten-inch pizza that I previously drenched in habañero Tabasco sauce. And also, how much time can one spend feeling guilty for doing things that feel great?

For real: I feel like shit a solid 99% of the time for reasons that are my own to deal with... but, on top of that, having to deal with the guilt of turning to most of the _quick-fix_, *feel-good*‚ _indulgent_ solutions I've found that alleviate my pain... turning to those bad habits for relief and then feeling extra bad? now that's really shitty.

Let me just grab a pizza real quick from the supermarket's frozen food aisle.

`6:46pm:` Something's gotta give.
