`12:01pm:` I'm about to make cheeseburgers, but I just wanted to update that blog and talk about how I've finally started toying around with ideas in Ableton Live, using that H5 recorder to lay some sick guitar tracks! Of course, most of it is pretty shitty but I'm having *mad fun* everyday, just playing, singing, mixing.

The weather has been fantastic these past few days; it's finally summer here, good things coming in the next few weeks. I think it's safe to say shit is gonna be dope as fuck, just because I believe in myself, and I believe in what the Universe has in store for me. It's all good my dudes.

Peace.

PS: I might actually try to re-record some vocals and just release a rough sketch on here, to get the ball rolling. We'll see. I ain't trying to create no hype, though: this track is simply the least shitty of the bunch.

`2:50pm:` Tried to come up with one more song today but, man, it's hard to land those chords sometimes! That's all part of learning, though...
