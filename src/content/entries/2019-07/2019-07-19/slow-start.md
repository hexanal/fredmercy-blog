`11:08am:` Having to work from home, on my cool desktop littered with cables, hooked up to synthesizers and other music gear... man, I wish I could just mess around with music all day.

I've got my setup back, now it's all about getting that mojo back. Getting that motivation to experiment, get more assiduous in my exercizes, more consistent.  These days it's hard... let's say it's because it's summer and I'm out and about almost every day, which is cool, I ain't complaining!

Finally, the guitar is equipped with new strings and sounds good. I should be able to get going with jamming and composing and experimenting...

`11:13am:` Nobody reading this right now, but I'm keeping the blog alive, for once. A long time ago I had a blog which lasted quite some time, and what kept it alive was a rather constant stream of music releases... it kept me going all through high school, haha! The goal is pretty much to replicate that now, and release silly songs or groups of songs every once in a while. Here's hoping I won't give up next month! Woooohooo!
