`2:29pm:` Man, these days it feels like I'm not discovering new things or new ideas anymore! It's crazy to be envious of people going back to school to learn new skills: school fucking sucks, dude! But at the same time, you get to meet new people, interested and interesting people, trying to learn something new every day.

Music, yeah, that's cool and easy and new artists are filling my Spotify playlists by the dozens. But it's more the other things, like... science shit, nature stuff, or even, you know, people stuff.

Or maybe I'm thinking about actual skills: like learning how to sew, how to knit, or do woodwork or something?

...for the time being though, I'd better focus on that guitar. I don't know... damn, what the fuck am I *really* doing?

Let me think about it for a couple more months, dude.

`2:36pm:` That was a very rambly entry! Don't worry though, I'll clean my act up in the future.
