description: gotta kill my damn ego
type: journal

`7:25pm:` Third week at this new job: it's going well, it's actually pretty great and I'm having fun and it motivates me to get even better. I'm still stuck on a personal/social level though and I'm hoping to unlock this sooner than later.

Creatively, I'm in a major rut and I can't get out. I feel a push, I feel an urge, I feel an itch but I can't scratch it. The music I compose sounds lifeless, contrived, without *zest*.

I simply cannot believe how fast this year went by... it's dizzying. I'm sick.

Please stop.
