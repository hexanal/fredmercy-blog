`8:04am:` I've been spending a bit of time trying out a bunch of stuff on this blog. Today I was thinking of retiring the <del><a href="/blog/photofeed" data-disable-transition>photofeed</a></del> because, in all honesty guys... I'm not going to post a lot on that. I'll probably just use a blog post for that.

So, yep. Quarantine is going well, thanks :)
