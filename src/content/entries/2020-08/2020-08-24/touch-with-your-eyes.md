`9:21am:` Because I'm busy taking care of a tiny human, it's not easy for me to experiment on code, or to work on this blog, or at least produce anything substancial, yet on my down time I get to read (and think about what I read) a lot.

These days, and ever since I started my blog, I've been on a some sort of mission. The mission is to regain control of my medium of choice, to go back to the basics and take back full possession of my virtual environment: the *networked computer*. We **all** use connected devices, be it a cellphone or a laptop, and yet few people can truly claim that they know how their devices' software works! It's cool... I get it, I know it's complicated, and it's the highly technical job of developers and engineers to figure out how to build it and sell it to consumers, so why worry?

But hold on there... my mission is broader. It's not only computer and software. It's about claiming back control, regain full understanding and knowledge, of most of the technology (in a broad sense) we use in our everyday lives.

Do you know how electricity works? I don't really know; and yet it's behind everything I use, everything that gave me a job and a livelihood.

Do you know how plants grow? How fabric is made? How engines work? etc.

Modern society gave us all this stuff, these magical substances and these mighty machines, invented and crafted by experts and those who don't understand them can still use them! It's fine. However, as a developer, I believe I *should* understand every aspect underlying my work. And it's deep. It's deep, and somewhat hidden... literally, in *code*. It's deep, because it now powers platforms that actually shift political power, it's a economic behemoth waking up from a slumber, ready to strike: and what I want, is to be part of the people who get to choose what this giant is going to do, or at least steer the beast toward a benevolent path.

I feel it is our responsibility to gain control of this virtual space before governments or corporations (worse!) wrap their dirty hands around it and choke it. There is much work to be done, and this is why it's fascinating and exciting and inspiring.

`9:47am:` Research avenues to make a change in this space (that's according to my own ideas, which I'm forming as I type this text, haha):

1. teaching the basics, clearly and pragmatically, of computers, programming, etc.
1. coming up with more "Free and Open-Source Software" ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) maintained by people who share the same vision (ties in with teaching programming: you get to train people to maintain the next generations of FOSS)
1. more broadly: educating people on the promises, limitations, and dangers of modern communication channels (by that I mean: TikTok, Instagram, Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. and their business model, what is at stake, what it adds to your life and how it can be replaced, etc. etc.)

Basically: I'm against those giant corporations unfurling their tentacles to capture every strategic outpost. I'm rooting for the little guy, for us all, working together for a better (== more fun) future!

`4:06pm:` yo, it's soooo hot today! Just walking slowly through the park has got me sweating like a hog!
