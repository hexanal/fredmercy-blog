title: Will I ever...
description: ...reboot that blog?
type: update

`1:29pm:` I'm still at it, trying to figure out what to do with this blog. The truth is: the blog is fine.

What I miss is: experimentation, and research. I should have tiny "micro-projects" with which to experiment on new technologies, to apply their principles on a basic app or whatever, but which would *also* include something I wanted to try... in terms of UX, in terms of design, in terms of UI.

From the *funky little projects* pile, I could pick the one about particle physics, where I would explain the basics of particles with 3D models in the browsers, and animations, etc. Obviously, it sounds like nothing to me when I casually give it a thought or two, but in practice I expect this project to require at least two full months of hard work (because they will be spread out to the moments in the day when I'm not on daddy duty)

Question is: do I believe the time investment to be wise? Depending on the scope of the project and how it's going in the first few iterations, maybe!

`1:52pm:` The only missing feature for this blog, is a way to edit stuff online, or at least to have a way to quickly add content. I might just refactor this current iteration to: a) use a better templating engine, b) add a *markdown edit* page, c) allow for *server-side compilation*

It can be done, and guess what, it can be done without React!

`2:23pm:` Those who know me, know that I have had a love affair with [Notion](https://notion.so): it's because it's really great at giving all the necessary tools to build pages that feel *alive*!

At some point, I even told my girlfriend that Notion could be like a replacement for "the web", because it could empower *regular folks* to build personal pages like in the old days. Unlike the old days however, Notion provides a clean UI on most platforms, and all the tools one needs to create a masterpiece.

They struck a nice balance between being a powerful tool and an overly "complex" one. The UI is honestly very simple, although I'll concede that some people still feel somewhat lost at first, especially if they have never used a similar tool before.

Anyways, I don't work for them, I'm not sponsored, etc. you'll probably hear other stories about it in the future if they play their cards right. Seems like they can boost their valuation to hits the stratosphere soon enough. This shit would be the anti-TikTok, haha! For sure kids aren't gonna use Notion, though. At heart, it's still a very business-like application.

The point is: I want my toolset to help me unleash boundless creativity, and I believe the way to achieve that is to have an *environment* that provides **many** tools that can be used in the same context, using the same principles. Sort of like *addons*, *extensions*, *plugins*, etc. Every piece of the environment would allow for composing, lego-like, your own personal cathedral. If you read a lot on web development, software engineering and the likes, you'll have read something that mentions LEGOs at some point, I'm sure! That's the goal.

Give me a great Notion API, and I'll use it for my backend in a heartbeat! 

Then again, I like to build my own tools, so we'll see!
