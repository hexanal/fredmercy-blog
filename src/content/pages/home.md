I'm a dude who builds things. Mostly websites and applications. But I try to make them the best they can be.

I like to build, tinker with, and imagine new things; I live to pleasantly surprise and stimulate people, mostly by creating innovative and pleasant interactions.

My programming style is loose and flexible and I try to code in whatever I can code in, you know? This is my website [(and web log)](/blog), and it's a window into [this dude](/this-dude)'s mind.
