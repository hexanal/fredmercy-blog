> In this page: I talk about how the Internet I knew and loved got hijacked by "geniuses".

You know the trope of the guy *plugging into virtual reality*, almost literally just jacking in Matrix-like? I feel like we're already very deep in that nowadays, like it's crazy. What's crazy is that I get to work in an industry that's all about building stuff **inside this reality**... That there's an industry that pays well, where you're paid to build virtual pages that are viewed by millions of other *connected* people.

I was born before the explosion of the Internet, but computers already fascinated me, so I've always known about it. It was too far, inaccessible; too adult, and too geeky even for me. But by age 12, I was a regular user of the Web and I was happy as hell.

On there, *in* there, I had found a world full of answers. And most of it was free: it was just a web of people sharing stuff. They got alhold of this new way of broadcasting a message to the World: it's not radio, it's not telephone... it's some digital craziness is what it is! They jacked into the *World Wide Web* and shared content. Man, that's what the Internet was about.

Now, I'm old. The Internet obviously grew grew and... became something else. It grew up, and now it's ultra powerful. It's everywhere. It has obviously replaced many things, to some extent: to use my own example as an anecdote, I don't watch TV anymore, I don't listen to the radio, I don't have a newspaper subscription (although I receive [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) every week! yay), I don't write on shit (nothing that *matters* at least), I don't go to the movies, etc.
Yo, it's friggin' everywhere for me! With this power must come great responsibilities as it goes but the Internet as a technology isn't truly separate from us: we still have the power to reign it in. We should never let it lull us into a state of complacency nor should we any other technology. Humans should wake up to the reality that their technological reach is tickling weird part of the Planet and stranger part of the human psyche.

On this blog, you'll read a lot about how advertising is really *fucked up*. You probably already know that instinctively: fuck ads before my YouTube videos, between my Instagram stories, etc. Ads suck. The advertising industry is a merchant of bullshit. It's coersion, it's manipulation, it's hypnosis, it's misdirection. I work in this industry and I'll make a post about that; but for now, I just want to say that the real problem... guys... is simply wealth distribution. Why is it pulling all that talent? Why is it a money gravity well? Because it fucking works. It's disgusting.

I call myself a hippie, but I'm a big fraud. I worked for the ad industry for a long long time, and it has paid for my lifestyle. Being able to build website is a great skill to have, for sure; but why use that to sell more bullshit to people? Because money?! Because a lifestyle is important to have? Yep.

Having chosen to become a web developer, I felt the Internet shifting from under me over the years. One year witnessing the absolutely staggering rise of Google<sup data-note="(which honestly, I was amazed by at the beginning)">[1]</sup>. Another year the creation and rise of Facebook. The Internet is being taken over by huge silos. We're now tracked everywhere we go, every site we visit. If you're logged into Facebook, they get your name, and your friends. They target ads with crazy accuracy, yadda yada! We all know that, right? Right? What can we do about it?

Can't put the genie back in the bottle: kids are on youtube, teens are on tiktok, adults are on twitter and facebook. We're all connected, and *manipulated*. Yeah but we're manipulated by ads, it's cool. Nah dude, it's not fucking cool, bro! I want to steer clear from anything that tries to manipulate me!

Shit, listen to me rant about the Internet. When you read the first paragraphs of this word-vomit, I sound super nostalgic of an *older, better* Internet. This is why I feel really old, man: I'm still fully employed working on those damn websites, but I understand nothing of this beast. It's cool to talk to people who have personal websites. For sure these people must be few and far between, but they exist. And obviously I'm talking about people who work in the industry, probably; otherwise they would have used a service like those *easy-baked* website-makers. I would love to be much much more underground and be a guy who makes websites for mom and pop's stores, their neighbors and their dogs, you know? I wish we could reclaim the Internet as it was a while ago: having a presence online we you could communicate however you wanted. Why rent a space on a third-party ad-riddled service like Facebook's?

Obviously, there's always something great about a website/app that brings EVERYBODY together. But could it instead by public? Couldn't it be open-sourced? Maybe the next step is a state-sponsored, totally end-to-end encrypted, low-power usage, locally-federated, well maintained, not-for-profit, widely cross-platform... search engine and messaging app?
