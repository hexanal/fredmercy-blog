/**
 * What's going on?
 * ----------------
 *
 * `moduler.use` accepts an object of middlewares: these are functions which are
 * passed the props for each of the found modules on the page, to "augment" them
 *
 * `moduler.mount` accepts a single DOM element; it will find all elements with
 * the attribute [data-component] and load the appropriate JS module for them.
 *
 * A module is a function which is passed an object, with this shape:
 *
 * `{ element, children, [other middlewares] }`
 *
 * - `element` is the DOM element found by `moduler`
 * - `children` is any element with a `[data-child]` attribute
 * - [other middlewares] in this case will be `events`, which is instantiated
 *   using the other props above -> useful to extend moduler
